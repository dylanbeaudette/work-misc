  Abstract                 = {Summary New data confirm that most petalites are slightly Li-deficient, Al-excessive and (OH)-bearing with respect to the idealized formula LiAlSi4O10. Primary substitution or secondary hydrolysis involving H+?Li+ or 3 Li+?Al3++2?, or both, are responsible. No evidence was found for either significant participation of other substitutions, or incipient alteration into hydrous silicates. The Fe content seems to be restricted to less than 0.003 per 20 oxygens. The Ga contents (22â64) and Al/Ga (3577â1378) are moderate, similar to other framework aluminosilicates in parent pegmatites. Statistically identical IR absorption spectra and unit-cell dimensions indicate ordered Si-Al-Li distribution in all natural as well as synthetic samples examined. For quartz-saturated bulk compositions, the stability field of petalite is bounded by beta-spodumene at high T, by spodumene at moderate to high P and T, and by eucryptite (or bikitaite) at low P and T. Kinetic factors such as sluggish reaction rates at low T and low solubilities of aluminosilicates in CO2-rich fluids may account for the metastable preservation of petalite in some pegmatites.},

  Abstract                 = {Terrain analysis of digital elevation models (DEM) has become an important technique to assess landscape and watershed scale hydrologic and pedologic processes and the spatial variability of soil and ecologic properties. Light detecting and ranging (LIDAR) elevation data sets provide the flexibility needed to produce multiple horizontal resolutions of DEM from the same data source. A series of 61 LIDAR tiles (100 ha) were collected from the North Carolina Flood Mapping Program covering the spatial extent of the Hofmann Forest in the Lower Coastal Plain of Eastern North Carolina. The LIDAR data set was reduced to 50%, 25%, 10%, 5%, and 1% of the original density. We created 5-, 10-, and 30-m DEM with 0.1 m vertical precision for each density level and used paired t-test to determine if the true mean of their differences were equal to zero. Differences indicated that for the 30-m DEM, LIDAR data sets could be reduced to 10% of their original data density without statistically altering the produced DEM. However, the 10-m DEM could only be reduced to 25% of the original data set before statistically altering the DEM. Data reduction was more limited for the 5-m DEM with possible reduction only to 50% of their original density without producing statistically different DEM. Our evaluation provides some indication as to the minimum required LIDAR data density to produce a DEM of a given horizontal resolution. However, evaluation of additional horizontal resolutions and additional density reduction is required to provide a clearer understanding of the effect of LIDAR data density.},

  Abstract                 = {Institutional and student surveys carried out in 1992 and 2004 suggest that soil science education is experiencing a significant decline in the United States and Canada. The present article reports on the data obtained in these surveys, particularly the fact that the enrollment in MSc and PhD programs in soil science in US and Canadian universities in 2004 was approximately 40% less than that in 1992. Some of the possible causes of this drop are analyzed in detail, such as the tendency of soil science education programs to keep emphasizing the agricultural side of soil science (i.e., its connection to crop production), despite the open intention of most students to pursue careers dealing predominantly, or at least in part, with environmental issues. It is argued that measures could still be taken by soil science educators and soil scientists to revert the downward trend in enrollments. Among these are licensing soil scientists, being vigilant about oversimplifications and misrepresentations of soil processes by researchers in other disciplines, expanding the scope of soil science and actively promoting its achievements, and making sure that the public at large is aware of the intrinsic, challenging complexity of soils and that it mandates a unique pluridisciplinary approach. We believe that if some of these measures were adopted, soil science could relatively and rapidly regain its place in the pantheon of science.},

  Abstract                 = {Soils are routinely sampled and characterized according to genetic horizons, resulting in data that are associated with principle dimensions: location (x, y), depth (z), and property space ( p ). The high dimensionality and grouped nature of this type of data can complicate standard analysis, summarization, and visualization. The “aqp” (algorithms for quantitative pedology) package was designed to support data-driven approaches to common soils-related tasks such as visualization, aggregation, and classification of soil profile collections. In addition, we sought to advance the study of numerical soil classification by building on previously published methods within an extensible and open source framework. Functions in the aqp package have been successfully applied to studies involving several thousand soil profiles. The stable version of the aqp package is hosted by \{CRAN\} (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/aqp), and the development version is hosted by R-Forge (http://aqp.r-forge.r-project.org). },

  Abstract                 = {Aspect angle is commonly used by soil scientists and ecologists as a qualitative proxy for landscape-scale variation in microclimate and microclimate-induced phenomena. This property of the landscape is simple to measure in the field and has a direct interpretation. Aspect angle is not easily integrated into more quantitative, physically based measures of landscape-scale phenomena, however, because (i) solar geometry, not aspect angle, drives near-surface processes, and (ii) there are numerical difficulties associated with periodic variables. We used the European Solar Radiation Atlas solar radiation model to generate an annual radiation load surface for subsequent modeling of microclimate-coupled near-surface processes at Pinnacles National Monument in California. Estimated annual solar radiation load values coupled with a local geologic map were used as predictor variables in a logistic regression model constructed to predict the spatial distribution of upland Mollisols. A total of 185 field observations were used to build the model, which had an 83 percent correctly classified (PCC) rate and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area of 0.78 to 0.96. A 50-fold cross-validation (repeated refitting of the model with a subset of observations) procedure indicated a mean classification error rate of 22%. Solar radiation modeling offers an exciting new approach for linking geographic information system and field observation in regions where microclimate-coupled soil-forming factors dominate pedogenesis. In addition, the quantification of a previously qualitatively described phenomena (the aspect effect) leads to a continuous description of soil taxonomic features at a much finer scale than is currently possible in soil survey.},

  Abstract                 = {The study of weathering and erosion processes requires the establishment of a mass balance of minerals from the soils towards the sedimentation area. This calls for the development of quantitative tools that can be applied to mixtures of finely divided and sometimes poorly crystallized minerals found in soils and sediments. We present here the use of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) absorbance spectroscopy in the mid-infrared as a method to calculate mineral modes for such materials. Samples were prepared using the KBr disc method. This ensures that Lambert-Beer's law is valid. A quantitative determination of the mineral content from various blends was performed by making a multicomponent analysis of the experimental spectrum using the spectra of each component in the mixture. To check the validity of the procedure, the multicomponent analysis was performed on spectra from synthetic mixtures of standard minerals (quartz, kaolinite, gibbsite, amorphous silica). Good agreement between actual and computed wt % was obtained in the range 1315-315 cm (super -1) . This application of FTIR spectroscopy was used to quantify the mineral components of a lacustrine sediment cored at Salitre, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The major phases are organic matter, kaolinite, gibbsite, quartz, anatase, and amorphous silica (phytoliths and sponge spicules). Fifty-three samples were analyzed. Quantitative results from FTIR spectroscopy were compared to chemical analyses to assess the validity of the method for the natural sediments. Phases with no sharp diagnostic spectral features, such as anatase or amorphous silica, were quantified using the multicomponent analysis. The variations of the main mineral phases along the core reflect the mechanisms of transfer from the surrounding soils to the sediment area and the role of the vegetal cover over the drainage area.},

  Abstract                 = {Spatial heterogeneity of ecological structures originates either from the physical forcing of environmental variables or from community processes. In both cases, spatial structuring plays a functional role in ecosystems. Ecological models should explicitly take into account the spatial structure of ecosystems. In previous work, we used a polynomial function of the geographic coordinates of the sampling sites to model broad-scale spatial variation in a canonical (regression-type) modelling context. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting and quantifying spatial patterns over a wide range of scales. This is obtained by eigenvalue decomposition of a truncated matrix of geographic distances among the sampling sites. The eigenvectors corresponding to positive eigenvalues are used as spatial descriptors in regression or canonical analysis. This method can be applied to any set of sites providing a good coverage of the geographic sampling area. This paper investigates the behaviour of the method using numerical simulations and an artificial pseudo-ecological data set of known properties.},

  Abstract                 = {Soil maps on a reconnaissance or semi-detailed scale are frequently used as the basic level of information for regional land use assessment. However, they are impractical for suitability predictions concerning quality crops, which require an enlargement of details that can be guaranteed only by detailed soil survey and mapping. The change of scale increases the importance of field observations and introduces in the soil-landscape model the fuzziness related to surveyor's subjective judgement. The present study explored the applicability of the fuzzy c-means approach to conventional soil surveys for detailed land use assessment with the purpose of taking into consideration the fuzziness of data collected in areas where soil type transitions are not easily observable on the surface. The investigation was done using data from 1888 auger borings of a 42 000-ha survey carried out in the lower part of the fluvial plain east of Venice on the 1:25 000 map scale. The morphological quantitative attributes of the master horizons A, Bw, Bg, Bk and C were first reduced in number so as to remove attribute redundancy. They were then submitted to fuzzy c-means, testing cluster validity with both internal and external criterion measures. The best partition was obtained with four classes, which were consistent with the main soil-forming processes of the area not only in terms of class centre features, but also of spatial variability and distribution pattern of the class memberships. The investigated approach might represent part of a complex analytical sequence capable of using both the spatial distribution of fuzzy continuous classes and the landform analysis to formulate a spatially detailed territorial model representing the basic level of information for a locally oriented land use assessment.},

  Abstract                 = {The movement towards precision agriculture has led to calls for soil maps that are more detailed and accurate than those offered in standard NCSS soil surveys. Studies have shown that soil variability can be greater than depicted in soil surveys; in fact, delineations that contain at least 50% of the soil mapped are considered satisfactory for soil survey purposes. Lacustrine plains are relatively flat and often have parent materials with uniform properties. Because soils are usually mapped using soil-landform relationships one might expect soil maps in these areas to be less accurate than average; it is difficult to delineate between map units using soil-landform relationships in such subtle landscapes. We grid-mapped a field containing lacustrine-derived soils in central Iowa and used the grid to evaluate the soil survey for accuracy. Two major and two minor soils, as determined by the area they occupy in the field, were present. For the field as a whole, the two major soils were correctly identified by the soil survey at least 63% of the time. The two minor soils were correctly identified 33% of the time or less by the soil survey. Large-scale soil mapping is expensive because of the time involved to create them in the field and in the office. Therefore, it is only economically beneficial to produce a detailed map if the map leads to significant alterations in the way a field is managed. In fields that may have uniform soil properties, it may be more cost-effective to conduct a reconnaissance survey first and then decide if more detailed mapping is required.},

  Abstract                 = {Inspired by the catena concept, we returned to the landscape of origin for this idea in central Uganda and applied quantitative soil–landscape-modeling techniques to the study of soil formation. In particular, we employed Generalized Least Squares (GLS) regression to identify potential terrain (and other) controls on surface texture with the goal of explaining texture contrast formation for well-drained red soils, and fluvial deposition for yellow–gray lowland soils. Well-drained red soils and poorly drained yellow–gray soils were identified using a high-resolution spectroradiometer and soil redness was highly correlated with a measure of elevation above the valley floor. For the yellow–gray soils, sand content and sand grain size increased with greater slope gradient and in converging areas—evidence supporting fluvial control of surface soil composition. For red soils, texture contrast increased on lower backslopes, decreased over ferricrete-rich parent material, and had no significant association with either infiltration- or runoff-influenced locations. Surprisingly, texture contrast was also reduced or even inverted on fine scale convexities (&lt;18 m in diameter). These findings were consistent with the following theoretical processes: (1) sand deposition on lower-backslopes, increasing texture contrast; (2) ferricrete weathering at the soil surface, reducing texture contrast; and (3) texture contrast inversion through termite turbation. A number of techniques proved useful in this study: (a) the use of \{GLS\} regression supported the interpretation of model coefficients in an explicitly spatial context; (b) thin-plate splines provided a flexible means of controlling the spatial scale of terrain index computation; and (c) the development of a new downslope-looking Elevation Above Stream (EASy) terrain index provided a powerful tool for the identification of poorly drained soils—a tool that could have applications in a variety of landscapes and environments. Overall, we found that the catena concept as a soil–terrain-modeling approach worked best on lower, less well-drained, depositional landscape components. For the well-drained portion of this landscape, there was little evidence to suggest that soil formation was controlled by hillslope hydrology as proposed by the catena concept. The catena concept interpreted in a broad sense challenges pedologists to explicitly link soil geographic patterns with specific soil forming processes and environmental controls—an approach that proved valuable in this study. },

  Abstract                 = {This article traces the development of conceptual paradigms of soil classification and mapping from the pre-1960's model of crisp classes in attribute space linked to crisply delineated mapping units in geographical space, to modern approaches using fuzzy classification and geostatistical interpolation for simultaneously handling continuous variation in both attributes and location. Continuous classification yields a separate map of class membership values for every class the dominance of any class at each location can be expressed by a confusion index, CI. If spatial correlation is strong, zones of high CI are concentrated in narrow geographical transition zones between locally dominant classes: these zones can be refined to delineate automatically classspecific boundaries. If spatial correlation in membership values is weak then broad zones of large values of CI occur all over the map. Simulation modelling and two case studies demonstrate that contiguity in geographical space is more important for successful mapping than attribute class compactness. The studies show that soil information systems must take the spatial aspects of soil variation into account; further improvements in identifying and mapping significant soil groupings should be possible using numerical models of soil processes together with the methods presented here.},

  Abstract                 = {Nowadays, French soil scientists tend to gather new and existing soil data into a common database. The use of this database potentially allows for resolving environmental issues, largely through soil mapping. The purpose of this study is to present a methodology for mapping soil types illustrated by typical observations in the soil database, in this case from the La Rochelle area on the French Mid-Atlantic Coast. The main hypothesis underlying the method is that soil types result from environmental factors such as landform, parent material, and land cover. The method can be divided into four stages. The first step is to construct a local soil type classification from the database by a two-stage continuous classification procedure. The result of this procedure is that at each observation point, the soil is described by a vector of taxonomic distances to each of k centroidal soil types. In the example given, k=18. The second step involves fitting soil-environment equations, one for each centroidal soil type, by regressing taxonomic distances on layers of multivariate environmental data observed on a fine 20-m grid, by multiple linear regression. In this case, the layers are terrain attributes derived from a digital elevation model and land cover attributes derived from three bands of a SPOT image. The third step is to predict k maps or raster GIS layers representing taxonomic distances to soil types on the 20-m grid, using the soil-environment equations and the kriging of the residuals from the regressions. This results in many potential maps: a summary map depicting the nearest centroidal soil type (the soil type for which the taxonomic distance is least) at each location is possibly the most useful, and another one representing the minimum taxonomic distance which, if considered too large, might suggest locations for further field survey to refine the soil types. A map of standard errors of the kriged taxonomic distance residuals to the nearest centroidal soil type can be made to indicate spatial uncertainty. Continuous fuzzy membership maps can also be constructed from the distances. The fourth step involves validation with an independent soil data set allowing discovery of the nature of the actual prediction errors. Thirty-eight percent of sites in a validation sample of 1234 sites was unequivocally validated, 23% was equivocally validated, and the remainder was predicted wrongly by the method.},

Terron is a whole entity integrating soil properties (pedon) with topographic soil-forming factors (represented here by landform attributes)--which can be assimilated to terroir. For terron mapping, landform is not only an interpolation support as it is in existing models, but also a taxonomic variable. Data from French databases are used to illustrate this concept. Terron mapping consists of four stages. First is the classification of n area-representative soil types with landform attributes by fuzzy k-means with extragrades into n terron classes. Second is the establishment of terron-landform rules using a multi-linear regression. Third is the interpolation of the terron-landform rules using regression-kriging. Fourth is validation with a second sample dataset. The results are compared with a soil map created with a regression-kriging model.},

A hydrological model integrating the soil-water measurements with digital terrain analysis and a one-dimensional water balance model was developed to map dominant hydrological patterns of soil-water storage and lateral flow redistribution. Statistical correlations between hydrologic behavior and the compound topographic index (CTI) generated from a digital elevation model (DEM) were used to generate spatially distributed input parameters of initial water storage and soil-controlled evapotranspiration utilized in the model. The results suggest that differences in water storage and availability are highly modified by climatic conditions and local topography. Nearly three times higher than normal rainfall in the El Nino year caused deeper infiltration of water and led to significant subsurface water redistribution into the concave hillslope positions which remained moist throughout the 1998 summer. Water infiltration and distribution was diminished considerably in the drier than normal La Nina, and led to a complete dry-down in 1999. Actual evapotranspiration was 87% of total precipitation during the El Nino, compared with 100% in the subsequent La Nina. The good correlation between modeled and measured water storage shows that even a simple one-dimensional model combined with the appropriate input parameters is a suitable tool for estimating changes in soil-water content on hillslopes where lateral flow is a significant functional component of the soil hydrology.},

Near-infrared reflectance spectra, obtained from a Perstrop NIR Systems 6500 scanning monochromator (Foss NIRSystems, Silver Spring, MD), and 33 chemical, physical, and biochemical properties were studied for 802 soil samples collected from four Major Land Resource Areas (MLRAs). Calibrations were based on principal component regression (PCR) using the first derivatives of optical density [log(1/R)] for the 1300- to 2500-nm spectral range. Total C, total N, moisture, cation-exchange capacity (CEC), 1.5 MPa water, basal respiration rate, sand, silt, and Mehlich III extractable Ca were successfully predicted by NIRS (r2 > 0.80). Some Mehlich III extractable metals (Fe, K, Mg, Mn) and exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, and K), sum of exchangeable bases, exchangeable acidity, clay, potentially mineralizable N, total respiration rate, biomass C, and pH were also estimated by NIRS but with less accuracy (r2 = 0.80[~]0.50). The predicted results for aggregation (wt% > 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25 mm, and macroaggregation) were not reliable (r2 = 0.46[~]0.60). Mehlich III extractable Cu, P, and Zn, and exchangeable Na could not be predicted using the NIRS-PCR technique (r2 < 0.50). The results indicate that NIRS can be used as a rapid analytical technique to simultaneously estimate several soil properties with acceptable accuracy in a very short time.},

Fresh litter and decomposed duff materials for the four dominant vegetation components of California oak woodlands: blue oak (Quercus douglassi H. & A.), live oak (Quercus wislizenii A. DC.), foothill pine (Pinus sabiniana Dougl.), and annual grasses, were exposed in natural condition for an entire rainy season (December to May) to evaluate their contributions of particulate (POC) and dissolved (DOC) organic carbon, particulate (PON) and dissolved (DON) organic nitrogen, inorganic nitrogen (NH4+ and NO3-), and trihalomethane (THM) and haloacetonitrile (HAN) formation potentials, to surface waters. Litter and duff materials can be significant sources of DOC (litter = 29- 126 mg DOC g-1 C; duff = 6.5-37 mg DOC g-1 C) and THMs and HANs (up to 4600 mg-THMs g-C-1 and 137 {micro}g-HANs g-C-1). Blue oak litter had the highest yield of DOC, THM, and HAN precursors. When scaled to the entire watershed, leachate production yielded 445 kg-DOC ha-1, as compared to DOC export via streams of 5.25 kg-DOC ha-1. DOC transport to surface waters is facilitated by subsurface lateral flow through A horizons during storm events. The majority of DOM and DBP precursors was leached from plant materials in the initial rainfall events and thus may explain the seasonal stream pattern of a DOC pulse early in the rainy season.},

  Abstract                 = {Variations of naturally emitted gamma radiation have been used in geological prospecting for over 20 years to detect anomalies associated with exploitable ore deposits. We examined their ability to detect spatial variation of soil material by comparing simultaneous ground and airborne measurements of gamma emissions with ground observations over a catchment in south-western Australia. Measurements were taken in the spectral windows for 40K, 238Uand 232Th. Variations of gamma radiation corresponded with the distribution of soil-forming materials over the landscape, and were used to distinguish between highly weathered residuum and fresh material from granitic outcrops. Gamma radiometric data also discriminated clearly between doleritic, lateritic and granitic soil parent materials. Airborne data indicated the distribution of these materials through the catchment, with the exception of dolerite dikes, which were too narrow to be detected using pixels greater than 20 m wide. It is concluded that gamma radiometric data can provide valuable insights into the spatial distribution of soil-forming materials but, given their limitations to provide direct information of pedological alteration, such data are likely to prove most valuable to soil survey when considered jointly with other information such as terrain models or aerial photography.},

  Abstract                 = {Soil development along an elevational transect on the western slopes of the the central Sierra Nevada was investigated to assess the effects of climate on soil properties and processes. The transect of seven soils formed in granitic residuum spans elevations from 198 to 2865 m with mean annual temperature and precipitation differences of 13ÔøΩC (3.9-16.7) and 94 cm (33-127), respectively. Soil pH decreased by about two units and base saturation decreased from 90 to 10% with increasing elevation. Concentrations of organic C in the solum increased with elevation, with the largest single increase occurring between the oak woodland (5-6 kg C/m2) and mixed-conifer sites (10-15 kg C/m2). Clay mineralogy showed a general trend of desilication and hydroxy-Al interlayering of 2:1 layer silicates with increasing elevation. The degree of chemical weathering, based on clay and secondary Fe oxide concentration in the solum, showed a maximum (clay = 536 kg/m2 and Fe OXIDES = 24 kg/m2) at mid-elevations having intermediate levels of precipitation and temperature. While some soil properties show a continuous progression (e.g., organic carbon, base saturation, clay mineralogy) with elevation, other properties (e.g., pH, soil color, clay and secondary Fe oxide concentrations) show a pronounced change (threshold-type step over a short distance at about 1600 m. The explanation for the abrupt nature of this shift is not known; however, it coincides with the approximate elevation of the present-day average effective winter snow-line.},

  Abstract                 = {Jurassic ophiolitic complexes in California and Oregon are widely distributed outboard of a Jurassic and older continental margin. Whether these outboard complexes were exotic and collided with the Jurassic continental margin, or whether they were simply part of a wide forearc to a Jurassic continental magmatic arc, has long been at issue. We have studied two such complexes and crosscutting intrusions in the fault-bounded Central and Western belts of the northern Sierra Nevada. We report new and revised U-Pb (zircon) dates for the Early Jurassic and younger Slate Creek complex (ca. 203−171 Ma) in the Central belt; the Late Jurassic Smartville complex (159 ± 3 Ma) in the Western belt; and crosscutting intrusions ranging from Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous age. The new ages imply that the Central and Western belts have been part of the same terrane since Middle Jurassic time and that the fault separating them has accommodated only minor displacements since ca. 160 Ma. Isotopic compositions of common Pb indicate derivation from mantle sources, but evidence for inheritance of Pre-cambrian zircon is common in plutons within the Early and Late Jurassic complexes and in Middle Jurassic, Late Jurassic, and Early Cretaceous crosscutting intrusions. Although there are several potential sources for such contamination, the ages of the inherited zircon are consistent with a North American origin. This contamination would have been accomplished most plausibly near the North American margin.},

  Abstract                 = {Using ion-exchange resin capsules for assessing nutrient supply in lowland rice (Oryza sativa L.) fields requires strategies for estimating field means of resin adsorption quantities (RAQs). To develop recommendations for on-site use of capsules, we conducted two experiments in rice fields on Typic Tropaquepts and Tropaqualfs in the Philippines. Resin capsules were placed in situ (ISI) or inserted into composite soil samples for on-site incubation (OSI). Capsules were retrieved after 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 d and RAQs of NH4-N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, Fe, and Mn were measured. In ISI or OSI of single soil cores, coefficients of variation in RAQs of N, P, and Fe ranged from 17 to 71\%, whereas those for K and Ca ranged from 10 to 20\%. Between one and five capsules per 0.25-ha field were required to estimate the average RAQ of P, K, and Ca after 14 d with a precision of +/- 10\%, compared with four to 10 capsules per field for estimating the RAQ of NH4-N and Fe after 14 d. Soil core sampling and OSI of composite soil samples reduced microvariability in RAQs. About eight to 10 soil cores (0‚Äì15-cm depth) were required per field for resin capsule OSI. Because of soil physical changes, degassing, and oxidation during soil mixing, RAQs of P, Fe, K, and Ca were lower for OSI than for ISI. The ISI method is recommended for routine soil testing in lowland rice fields. The OSI requires fewer capsules but more labor. Its reliability depends on the extent to which mechanical disturbance, degassing, and exposure to air can be minimized.},

For any survey a scheme should be designed specifying how and where data are to be recorded in the field, and how they are to be analysed statistically. Three formal levels are distinguished as the basis for a knowledge-based system for designing soil survey schemes. The first level depicts the role of the design in a survey project, the second distinguishes different steps in the design, and the third defines a framework of the basic concepts. Choosing a sampling design and comparing the accuracy of possible designs are essential in our support system. The accuracy of results from a scheme is defined as the mean squared error due to sampling. A computational method to predict the sampling error from prior information in the form of variograms is given and is illustrated with a case study.},

  Abstract                 = {Spatial structures of ecological communities may originate either from the dependence of community structure on environmental variables or/and from community-based processes. In order to assess the importance of these two sources, spatial relationships must be explicitly introduced into statistical models. Recently, a new approach called principal coordinates of neighbour matrices (PCNM) has been proposed to create spatial predictors that can be easily incorporated into regression or canonical analysis models, providing a flexible tool especially when contrasted to the family of autoregressive models and trend surface analysis, which are of common use in ecological and geographical analysis. In this paper, we explore the theory of the PCNM approach and demonstrate how it is linked to spatial autocorrelation structure functions. The method basically consists of diagonalizing a spatial weighting matrix, then extracting the eigenvectors that maximize the Moran's index of autocorrelation. These eigenvectors can then be used directly as explanatory variables in regression or canonical models. We propose improvements and extensions of the original method, and illustrate them with examples that will help ecologists choose the variant that will better suit their needs.},

  Abstract                 = {1 Global warming will probably shift treelines upslope in alpine areas and towards the pole in arctic environments. However, responses of regional treelines to climatic trends over the last century do not show any clear trends. We hypothesize that these equivocal responses may partly be caused by limitation of dispersal and/or recruitment that is species-specific to particular trees with potentially expanding ranges. 2 To test this hypothesis, we established and parameterized a temporally and spatially explicit model of plant spread and analysed its sensitivity to: (a) variation in predicted climatic trends; (b) the spatial distribution of recruits around a seed source; and (c) variation in the resistance of resident non-woody vegetation to invasion. We used data from a high mountain landscape of the Northern Calcareous Alps in Austria where the treeline is dominated by Pinus mugo Turra, a shrubby pine. 3 Low growth rates and long generation times, together with considerable dispersal and recruitment limitation, resulted in an overall slow range expansion under various climate-warming scenarios. 4 Running the model for 1000 years predicted that the area covered by pines will increase from 10% to between 24% and 59% of the study landscape. 5 The shape of the dispersal curve and spatial patterns of competitively controlled recruitment suppression affect range size dynamics at least as severely as does variation in assumed future mean annual temperature (between 0 °C and 2 °C above the current mean). Moreover, invasibility and shape of the dispersal curve interact with each other due to the spatial patterns of vegetation cover in the region. 6 Ambiguous transient responses of individual treeline systems may thus originate not only from variation in regional climatic trends but also from differences in species' dispersal and recruitment behaviour and in the intensity and pattern of resistance of resident alpine vegetation to invasion.},

Therefore these methods yield only estimates of PSD. The objective of this study was to determine whether a functional relationship exists between the PSDs obtained by the combined sieve-pipette method and those obtained by LD. Samples from 42 California soils were analyzed. For the LD measurements a Beckman-Coulter LS-230 apparatus with a 750-nm laser beam that measures particles in the range of 0.04 to 2000 {micro}m was used, employing the Mie theory for the PSD calculations. Values of 1.5 and 0.2 for the real part and the imaginary term of the refractive index (RI), respectively, gave satisfactory results for the optical model calculations. Volume percentage of the clay-size fraction obtained by LD was generally lower than mass percentage of the clay fraction derived by the pipette method. The opposite trend was noted for the silt-size fraction. Coefficients of determination for the regression equations for the clay, silt, and sand fractions determined by the two methods were 0.702, 0.689, and 0.821, respectively. Good agreement between measured and calculated LD values for one size class was accompanied by poor agreement between measured and calculated values for the other. The LD method provides a continuous PSD curve, which enables a detailed data analysis and a flexible application of different particle-size dependent classification systems.},

The models implement equations describing potential evapotranspiration which vary with vegetational cover and soil type and which separate runoff and percolation. Values of potential evapotranspiration are compared with more complex equations such as Penman's equation. The SWBBM/B model is validated with evapotranspiration patterns for major vegetation types, with percolation data from field lysimetric trials and tested for sensitivity to input parameters. The SWBBM/B model is considered suitable for reconstructing soil water content and runoff in paleoclimatology.},

  Abstract                 = {Conventional throughfall collection methods are labor intensive and analytically expensive to implement at broad scales. This study was conducted to test an alternative approach requiring infrequent sample collection and a greatly reduced number of chemical analyses. The major objective of the study was to determine the feasibility of using ion exchange resin (IER) to measure N deposition in throughfall with field deployment periods of 3 to 12 mo. Nitrogen deposition measurements in bulk throughfall collected under pine (Pinus sp.) canopies and in forest clearings were compared between co-located conventional throughfall solution collectors and IER throughfall collectors using mixed bed IER columns. Deposition data were collected for 1 yr at a high deposition site (Camp Paivika, CP) and a relatively low one (Barton Flats, BF) in the San Bernardino Mountains in southern California: Annual throughfall deposition values (kg ha-1 of NH4-N + NO3-N) under large ponderosa pine trees (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) were 145.8 and 143.9 at CP and 17.0 and 15.0 at BF according to the IER and conventional methods, respectively. Analogous values for bulk deposition in forest clearings were 15.6 and 12.3 at CP and 4.0 and 3.3 at BF. It was concluded that the IER collectors can be used for routine monitoring of deposition in throughfall and bulk deposition, provided that field blanks are used to account for background levels of N in the IER columns, which at times are slightly elevated, possibly from slow release of amine groups from the anion exchange resin during field exposures.},

  Abstract                 = {Evapotranspiration, a major component in terrestrial water balance and net primary productivity models, is difficult to measure and predict. This study compared five models of potential evapotranspiration (PET) applied to a ponderosa pine forest ecosystem at an AmeriFlux site in Northern California. The AmeriFlux sites are research forests across the United States, Canada, Brazil, and Costa Rica with instruments on towers that measure carbon, water, and energy fluxes into and out of the ecosystems. The evapotranspiration models ranged from simple temperature and solar radiation-driven equations to physically-based combination approaches and included reference surface and surface cover-dependent algorithms. For each evapotranspiration model, results were compared against mean daily latent heat from half-hourly measurements recorded on a tower above the forest canopy. All models calculate potential evapotranspiration (assuming well-watered soils at field capacity), rather than actual evapotranspiration (based on soil moisture limitations), and thus overpredicted values from the dry summer seasons of 1997 and 1998. A soil moisture function was integrated to estimate actual evapotranspiration, resulting in improved accuracy in model simulations. A modified Priestley-Taylor model performed well given its relative simplicity.},

  Abstract                 = {It appears that nearly all the discussions in pedology that seem to be about classification are really about nomenclature. A new system of soil classification and soil nomenclature is proposed in which it is suggested that all soil horizons be recognised, defined, named and be given symbols which are made up of the first letter of the name plus one other. Each soil is given a formula compiled by placing in order the symbol for each horizon, followed by a subscript number which indicates the depth of each horizon and so the depth of the whole soil. Each set of symbols represents a different soil group. A synaptic classification, which would have classes and subclasses, is produced by ad hoc methods. These classes would have names such as podzol and chernozem, but would have somewhat diffuse definitions. The subclasses are established on the basis of two or three prominent horizons in the same soil and are designated by placing the symbols for the horizons in square brackets.},

  Abstract                 = {The ISRIC WISE Global soil database was used to develop broad quantitative relationships between the environmental factors of climate, parent material and topography and a range of important soil properties (pH, sum of bases, organic carbon, clay content and others). Three different analytical approaches were used in the analysis, involving (i) multiple linear regressions, (ii) fitted decision trees and (iii) categorical analysis with median values.

The strengths of the predictive relationships are generally only moderate at best, with R2 values in the regression relationships typically in the range 0.2 to 0.4 and a wide spread in inter-quartile values in categorical median results. Testing with 100 random samples revealed only broadly moderate accuracy for the soil property predictions, with root mean square error down to 0.84 for pH predictions and down to 2.6 cmolc/kg for sum of bases. Despite their low strengths, the predictive relationships can provide useful first approximations of soil character under different environmental conditions and could be applied in broad quantitative soil modelling and mapping programs. They have the potential for widespread application as they should be universally applicable, are based on readily available data and do not require sophisticated quantitative modelling techniques.

The relationships revealed in the study can assist in our understanding of soil formation and soil distribution. Most relationships are in accord with accepted pedological thinking and support the state factor model of soil formation, but some anomalies are observed and deserve further examination. The results reveal the dominant influence of climate and parent material in controlling the distribution of many soil properties, with the influence of topography being less evident, at least at the global scale.},

  Abstract                 = {A model of Linke's turbidity factor, TL, is developed by means of updated spectral extraterrestrial irradiances and extinction coefficients of gaseous absorbers. It is shown that the new values of TL are clearly different from those obtained by Kasten's formula which parameterizes the optical thickness of the clean dry atmosphere. The model is used to investigate the dependence of TL on the relative optical air mass and to elucidate the relationships linking TL to Angstrom's turbidity coefficient and to the water vapor content.For any TL, the corresponding value related to the air mass 2.0 can be determined. Such a standardized value is independent of solar elevation and is therefore strictly representative of the atmospheric turbidity. It can be linked to Angstrom's turbidity coefficient.Practical procedures and algorithms for computing the standard Linke's turbidity factor and determining Angstrom's turbidity coefficient are described. A relationship for converting the TL values obtained by Kasten's formula into the new values is proposed.},

  Abstract                 = {The history of digital soil mapping and modeling (DSMM) is marked by adoption of new mapping tools and techniques, data management systems, innovative delivery of soil data, and methods to analyze, integrate, and visualize soil and environmental datasets. DSMM studies are diverse with specialized, mathematical prototype models tested on limited geographic regions and/or datasets and simpler, operational DSMM used for routine mapping over large soil regions. Research-focused DSMM contrasts with need-driven DSMM and agency-operated soil surveys. Since there is no universal equation or digital soil prediction model that fits all regions and purposes the proposed strategy is to characterize recent DSMM approaches to provide recommendations for future needs at local, national and global scales. Such needs are not solely soil-centered, but consider broader issues such as land and water quality, carbon cycling and global climate change, sustainable land management, and more. A literature review was conducted to review 90 DSMM publications from two high-impact international soil science journals -- Geoderma and Soil Science Society of America Journal. A selective approach was used to identify published studies that cover the multi-factorial DSMM space. The following criteria were used (i) soil properties, (ii) sampling setup, (iii) soil geographic region, (iv) spatial scale, (v) distribution of soil observations, (vi) incorporation of legacy/historic data, (vii) methods/model type, (viii) environmental covariates, (ix) quantitative and pedological knowledge, and (x) assessment method. Strengths and weaknesses of current DSMM, their potential to be operationalized in soil mapping/modeling programs, research gaps, and future trends are discussed. Modeling of soils in 3D space and through time will require synergistic strategies to converge environmental landscape data and denser soil datasets. There are needs for more sophisticated technologies to measure soil properties and processes at fine resolution and with accuracy. Although there are numerous quantitative models rooted in factorial models that predict soil properties with accuracy in select geographic regions they lack consistency in terms of environmental input data, soil properties, quantitative methods, and evaluation strategies. DSMM requires merging of quantitative, geographic and pedological expertise and all should be ideally in balance.},

  Abstract                 = {Little attention has been paid to analyses of pedodiversity. In this study, quantitative aspects of pedodiversity were explored for the USA based on the State Soil Geographic database (STATSGO). First, pedodiversity indices for the conterminous USA were estimated. Second, taxa-area relationships were investigated in each soil taxonomic category. Thirdly, differences in pedodiversity between the USDA-NRCS geographical regions were compared. Fourth, the possible mechanisms underlying the observed relative abundance of soil taxa were explored. Results show that as the taxonomic category decreases from order to series, Shannon's diversity index increases because taxa richness increased dramatically. The relationship between the number of taxa (S) and area (A) is formulated as S=cAz. The exponent z reflects the taxa-richness of soil [`]communities' and increases constantly as taxonomic categories decrease from order to series. The #West# USDA-NRCS geographical region has the highest soil taxa richness, followed by the #Northern##Plains# region. The #South##Central# region has the highest taxa evenness, while taxa evenness in the #West# region is the lowest. The #West# or the #South##Central# regions have the highest overall soil diversity in the four highest taxonomic categories, while the #West# or #Northern##Plains# regions have the highest diversity in the two lowest taxonomic levels. The high diversity index in the #West# region results from high taxa richness while the high diversity index in the #South##Central# region results from an evenness of taxa. As the taxonomic level decreases, the pattern of taxa abundance approaches a lognormal distribution. One of the key findings of this research is that at lower levels of soil taxonomic divisions (especially the series level), soil taxa increase continuously with increasing area, indicating considerable soil endemism in the USA (and likely around the world), a key consideration in conservation and preservation planning.},

  Abstract                 = {The Sierra Nevada metamorphic belt constitutes an important record of the growth of continental crust from essentially oceanic materials. In the northern Sierra, the central part of the belt is made up of volcanoplutonic arcs and sediment-dominated units inferred to be accretionary wedges or closed ocean basins. The latter are broken formation and mélange composed of radiolarian chert, lava, and volcanogenic and continental turbidites. Sedimentary detritus in the largest of these units can be plausibly linked to sources farther east in the Sierra, suggesting that deposition occurred near the eastern Sierran arc. Isoclinal folds, steeply dipping foliations, and steeply plunging down-dip lineations are characteristic structures. The westernmost unit is only feebly recrystallized, and deformation was accomplished principally by stress solution and local redeposition in veins. More easterly, inboard units are compositionally similar, but they recrystallized at pumpellyite-actinolite- and blueschist-facies conditions and deformed via solution-transfer and dislocation creep. Phengite silica contents, the degree of quartz veining, and the locations of pseudo-isograds support an eastward increase in metamorphic pressure and temperature. Metamorphic conditions during the growth of pumpellyite and actinolite ranged from ∼150-350 °C and 200-400 MPa, compatible with recrystallization and deformation in subduction zones or the deeper levels of magmatic arcs. Ar/Ar ages of volcaniclastic rocks and crosscutting plutons constrain the age of deformation and metamorphism in the western part of the region to 174-165 Ma. Deformation and recrystallization in more easterly units may have been coeval or begun as early as Triassic time.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Digital soil morphometrics is defined as the application of tools and techniques for measuring and quantifying soil profile attributes and deriving continuous depth functions. This paper reviews how proximal soil sensing and other tools can be used in soil profile descriptions where techniques and toolkits have not changed in the past decades. The application of such tools is compared to standard soil profile descriptions for 11 common attributes: horizons, texture, color, structure, moisture, mottles, consistence, carbonates, rock fragments, pores and roots. These attributes are extensively used in soil classification and are indicative of many soil functions. There has been progress in distinguishing soil horizons, texture and soil color, mainly using visâ€“NIR, \{GPR\} and electrical resistivity. There is potential for in situ digital morphometrics for all attributes of a soil profile. Smaller depth increments can be sampled and analyzed, and that gives continuous depth functions of soil properties. The combined use of in situ digital morphometrics and continuous depth functions of soil properties may enhance our pedological understanding. It will take time before the toolbox of the field pedologists will be digitally enriched, but we think that digital soil morphometrics has the potential to complement existing description and analytical methods. It may yield new insights in soil horizonation, how soils form and how they could be classified.},

  Abstract                 = {Modern pollen assemblages from the major vegetation units (both natural and anthropogenic) on the island of Hailuoto, Finland are studied from 29 surface moss samples. A total of 59 pollen and spore taxa are recorded. The pollen data-set is related by redundancy analysis (RDA) to six external synthetic variables that characterize in general terms the different major ecological situations relevant to the land-use on the island (sand, humus, forest, field, deforested, treeless). Weighted average (WA) optima are calculated to identify which pollen taxa are most indicative of four of these external variables. Two fossil pollen diagrams from Hailuoto are re-interpreted by positioning their samples on the RDA plot of the modern data-set and by classifying the modern and fossil spectra together in a minimum-variance cluster analysis. The RDA plot shows that the strongest features in the modern pollen assemblages are the contrast between spectra from dry sandy soils and those from damper soils with more organic content, and between assemblages from forested and unforested areas. For anthropogenic situations the numerical analyses detect a distinction in the pollen assemblages characterizing fields from those representing farms and trackways but is less successful in separating the latter two. The WA optima indicate that most pollen taxa considered as indicator types primarily represent a mixed field/farm category of land-use. The RDA and minimum-variance cluster analysis confirm that the two fossil sites have had different vegetational histories. In neither is there any phase equivalent to the modern farm situation on Hailuoto. The initial phase in each diagram represents shore meadows and fields but because Poaceae pollen is identifiable only to family level it is not possible to separate these two habitat types.},

  Abstract                 = {Inorganic carbon (C) comprises approximately a third of the total C pool in soils worldwide, largely in the form of pedogenic calcite. Pedogenic calcite occurs in semi-arid and arid regions in the form of calcareous, calcic, and petrocalcic horizons. Understanding the processes governing the storage and flux of this inorganic C pool is crucial to the development of accurate regional and global C budgets. Objectives of this study were to: (1) develop a process-based pedogenic calcite model that accounts for landscape hydrology and geomorphic position, (2) calibrate model parameters with field data from a Mojave Desert landscape, and (3) apply the model to understanding soil inorganic C response to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Two parameters are introduced in this study to account for surface water redistribution on the landscape: the precipitation threshold (Ω) and the topographic index threshold (Λ). These parameters account for runoff-generating rainfall events (Ω) and the potential to shed or collect water at a location (Λ). A one-dimensional compartmentalized thermodynamic model is used to simulate calcite precipitation and dissolution. Geomorphic delineation, sediment collected from dust traps, and detailed soil descriptions including percent sand and clay, and bulk density from 16 soil pits of the southern Fry Mountain piedmont served as inputs into the model. Precipitation and temperature inputs were simulated using stochastic models. Time steps for the sample sites used to calibrate the model were determined from optically-stimulated luminescence dates. Incorporation of precipitation and topographic index thresholds into the model allowed more information to be extracted from carbonate depth distributions than previous pedogenic calcite models. The model predicts a net loss of inorganic C from the upper 10 cm soil depth under elevated atmospheric CO2 and a consequent gain in the 10–20 cm depth. The leaching of calcite from shallow depths to below 10 cm is evident in all landforms including those most susceptible to wind erosion. This leads to the conclusion that increased atmospheric CO2 levels may result in a concentration of inorganic C at a depth that is protected from wind erosion creating a more geomorphically stable pool of C.},

  Abstract                 = {Thomas S. Kuhn developed the paradigm theory of science. The soil survey is an example of paradigm-based science. The soil-landscape model, on which the soil survey is based, is an operative paradigm. An extreme reliance on tacit knowledge, the knowledge gained by experience, creates serious inefficiencies, both in learning the soil-landscape paradigm and in disseminating the information resulting from its application. This article introduces concepts important to understanding paradigm theory and the nature of tacit knowledge. Among these are elements of Gestalt psychology, the theory of natural families, maps as conveyors of knowledge, and the linguistic nature of human perception. Students and field soil scientists should be provided explicit instruction concerning the paradigm on which soil mapping and interpretation are based. I also recommend that more of the soil geographic relationships discovered while making detailed soil maps be described and published so that the knowledge can be communicated to others.},

  Abstract                 = {The paper describes a model of the soil system. There are two different, partly complementary means of building such a model. One approach is to construct, using empirical physical science methods, an isomorphic model, in which each and every component (variable) of the system is an element in the model. The other approach is to build, using a systems synthesis methodology, a homomorphic model, in which several components of the system are grouped to form a single element in the model. The latter method is adopted in this paper because of its suitability for modelling at the level of the whole soil system. As regards forming the basis of a homorphic model of the whole soil system, existing concepts of soil genesis have limitations: either they are very complex isomorphic models, the implementation of which presents virtually insurmountable problems; or they are homomorphs but too general to be used in their present form. And the concepts make no reference to the functional boundaries of soil system units. Indeed, such a unit has not yet been satisfactorily defined; the nearest to it is the soil catena, which is considered at length in the paper. Some of these problems are resolved by the concept of soil landscape systems which, synoptically, is as follows. A basic functional of the soil system, it is proposed, is a three-dimensional body of soil known as a soil landscape system or a #valley##basin#, that (1) is bounded by the soil surface, valley watershed and weathering front at the base of the soil; (2) forms part of a more extensive valley basin network; and (3) functions as an open system. The flux of solids, colloids and solutes within and across the landscape is shown to be organized within the framework of these soil system units, and is discussed in terms of inputs, outputs and storages of the soil skeleton (clastic sediment) subsystem, the soil plasma subsystem and the soil solution subsystem. The value if the soil landscape system concept as a homomorphic model is stated. Five main advantages are outlined which relate to the five main features of the model: it has clearly and comprehensively defined basic system elements; it has functionally defined, three-dimensional system boundaries; the relationships between elements can be established from empirical hypotheses; there is transport and conservation of matter and energy as in the very successful models of hydrological systems and ecosystems; change of the system through time can be directly studied by computer simulation and not indirectly by statistical extrapolation from empirically derived behaviour patterns. The model, it is hoped, should provide a rational physical basis for simulating soil systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Three major challenges are present when studying anthropogenic impacts on soil profile properties: (i) site selection; (ii) sampling and modeling native and cultivated soil–landscape relationships; and (iii) graphically and statistically comparing native and cultivated sites to model soil profile changes. This study addressed those challenges by measuring and modeling selected soil profile properties of paired (native) forest and analogous nonnative (cultivated) loess hillslopes in central Missouri. The paired hillslopes in Saline County were mapped as Mollic Hapludalfs and the paired hillslopes in Boone County were mapped as Typic Hapludalfs. Horizonation and depth distribution of Hapludalf soil properties provide markers when measuring land use impacts on soil profile properties. Summit pedons on the four sites verified the mapping and classification. Transect data revealed soil profile variation by slope position and by site. Regression analysis identified relationships at the p < 0.007 level between depth to clay maximum (adjusted R2 = 0.74), thickness of the A horizon (adjusted R2 = 0.32), thickness of the subsurface horizon (adjusted R2 = 0.69), depth to the top of the B horizon (adjusted R2 = 0.69), clay content of the surface horizon (R2 = 0.76), organic C content of the surface horizon (adjusted R2 = 0.56), and depth to ≤7.5 g kg-1 organic C (adjusted R2 = 0.59) and slope position and site characteristics. A different response surface for each site for each soil characteristic supported the hypothesis that vegetative history and land use significantly affected the distribution of these soil properties.},

  Abstract                 = {Knowledge of soil chemistry is useful in assessing the sensitivity of forested areas to natural and anthropogenic disturbances, but characterizing large areas is expensive because of the large sample numbers required and the cost of soil chemical analyses. We collected and chemically analyzed soil samples from 72 sites within a 214-ha watershed in the Catskill Mountains of New York to evaluate factors that influence soil chemistry and whether terrain features could be used to predict soil chemical properties. Using geographic information system (GIS) techniques, we determined five terrain attributes at each sampling location: (i) slope, (ii) aspect, (iii) elevation, (iv) topographic index, and (v) flow accumulation. These attributes were ineffective in predicting the chemical properties of organic and mineral soil samples; together they explained only 4 to 25% of the variance in pHw, effective cation-exchange capacity (CECe), exchangeable bases, exchangeable acidity, total C, total N, and C/N ratio. Regressions among soil properties were much better; total C and pHw together explained 33 to 66% of the variation in exchangeable bases and CECe. Total C was positively correlated with N ( [IMG]f1.gif" BORDER="0"> in Oa horizons and mineral soil, respectively), exchangeable bases [IMG]f2.gif" BORDER="0"> , and CECe [IMG]f3.gif" BORDER="0"> , indicating the importance of organic matter to the chemistry of these acidic soils. The fraction of CECe occupied by H explained 44% of the variation in pHw. Soil chemical properties at this site vary on spatial scales finer than typical GIS analyses, resulting in relationships with poor predictive power.

  Abstract                 = {Vegetation, which is generally considered a co-variable controlled by climate in studies of pedogenesis, can itself alter the balance of soil-forming processes by modifying the microclimate. The chaparral and pine biosequence at the San Dimas Experimental Forest (SDEF) in southern California offers an opportunity to determine the effect of individual species on soil microclimate and related soil properties. Soil temperature and moisture were monitored under pure stands of Coulter pine (Pinus coulteri B. Don), chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum Hook. and Arn.), and scrub oak (Quercus dumosa Nutt.). Despite the appreciable differences in soil morphology that have evolved under pine compared with oak, the microclimates created by the dense canopies and thick litter layers (7-10 cm) of these two vegetation types were similar. Average monthly soil temperatures within the top 65 cm ranged from about 8 to 20{degrees}C under pine and 7 to 18{degrees}C under oak. Average monthly water contents ranged from 8 to 32% (by volume) under pine and 6 to 32% under oak. In contrast, average monthly soil temperatures within the top 65 cm under chamise ranged from 6 to 23{degrees}C and average monthly water contents were 6 to 36%. Diurnal variation in soil surface temperature under chamise was much more pronounced than under oak and pine because of the relatively open canopy and thin litter layer. Microclimate created by chamise may play an important role in the decomposition rate of litter, but appears to have little influence on soil processes occurring within the mineral soil. Soil macrofaunal communities appear to have a greater effect than microclimate in causing the divergent soil morphologies under oak and pine.},

The basic processes whereby plants directly influence the soil chemical environment is through the generation of weathering agents, biocycling of cations, and the production of biogenic minerals. Plants may indirectly influence soil processes through the alteration of regional hydrology and local soil hydrologic regime which determines the residence time of water available for weathering. We provide a brief review of the current state of knowledge regarding the effects of plants on mineral weathering and critical knowledge gaps are highlighted. We summarize approaches that may be used to help quantify the effects of plants on soil weathering such as state factor analyses, mass balance approaches, laboratory batch experiments and isotopic techniques. We assess the changes in the soil chemical environment along a tropical bioclimatic gradient and identify the possible effects of plant production on the soil mineralogical composition. We demonstrate that plants are important in the transfer of atmospheric carbon dioxide into the mineral weathering cycle and speculate how this may be related to ecosystem properties such as NPP. In the soils of Hawaiian rainforests subjected to deforestation, pasture grasses appear to change the proportion of non crystalline to crystalline minerals by altering the soil hydrologic regime or partitioning silica into more stable biogenic forms. A better understanding of the relationship between soil weathering processes and ecosystem productivity will assist in the construction predictive models capable of evaluating the sensitivity of biogeochemical cycles to perturbations.},

  Abstract                 = {The 1:50,000 national soil survey of the Netherlands, completed in the early 1990s after more than three decades of mapping, is gradually becoming outdated. Large-scale changes in land and water management that took place after the field surveys have had a great impact on the soil. Especially oxidation of peat soils has resulted in a substantial decline of these soils. The aim of this research was to update the national soil map for the province of Drenthe (2680 km2) without additional fieldwork through digital soil mapping using legacy soil data. Multinomial logistic regression was used to quantify the relationship between ancillary variables and soil group. Special attention was given to model-building as this is perhaps the most crucial step in digital soil mapping. A framework for building a logistic regression model was taken from the literature and adapted for the purpose of soil mapping. The model-building process was guided by pedological expert knowledge to ensure that the final regression model is not only statistically sound but also pedologically plausible. We built separate models for the ten major map units, representing the main soil groups, of the national soil map for the province of Drenthe. The calibrated models were used to estimate the probability of occurrence of soil groups on a 25 m grid. Shannon entropy was used to quantify the uncertainty of the updated soil map, and the updated soil map was validated by an independent probability sample. The theoretical purity of the updated map was 67\%. The estimated actual purity of the updated map, as assessed by the validation sample, was 58\%, which is 6\% larger than the actual purity of the national soil map. The discrepancy between theoretical and actual purity might be explained by the spatial clustering of the soil profile observations used to calibrate the multinomial logistic regression models and by the age difference between calibration and validation observations.},

  Abstract                 = {The quantification of soil organic C (SOC) concentrations is becoming increasingly more desirable because of environmental and economic concerns regarding the reactivity of SOC with pesticides, fertilizers, and waste materials. The objectives of this study were to quantify soil color organic C relationships and to quantify soil particle-size organic C relationships for Ap horizons in north central Iowa. All of the 130 soils examined developed in glacigenic diamicton or local hillslope sediment derived from glacigenic diamicton. A Minolta CR-310 chroma meter was used to quantify the percentage of reflectance, and Munsell value and chroma for both air-dry and moist soils. Organic C concentration of the sample set ranged from 4.4 to 70.8 g kg-1. Significant relationships were observed between organic C concentration and percentage of reflectance (r2 = 0.77 moist, r2 = 0.74 air-dry), Munsell value (r2 = 0.77 moist, r2 = 0.74 air-dry), Munsell chroma (r2 = 0.68 moist, r2 = 0.77 air-dry), the percentage of sand (r2 = 0.74), the percentage of clay (r2 = 0.71), and geometric mean particle diameter (GMPD) (r2 = 0.74). Logarithmic relationships existed for reflectance, Munsell value and chroma, and GMPD while linear relationships were observed for sand and clay contents. Chroma meter soil color measurements and particle-size data are useful predictors of organic C concentrations for Ap horizons in north central Iowa. Evidence from this study and the literature suggest that unique relationships exist for different soil landscapes.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we discuss the recent kinetic work on water-rock interactions. Standard activity-activity diagrams are reinterpreted, using a mass transfer kinetic model and recent data on the relative rates of mineral reactions. The development of a fully integrated rate law is discussed, with special attention to the important effects of deviation from equilibrium on the rates of mineral-water reactions. The combined effects of temperature, pH, ionic strength, and saturation conditions on the overall dissolution and precipitation rates of minerals must be properly described before any seriously quantitative model of coupled fluid flow and chemical reaction can be undertaken. A rate law that integrates these effects is proposed. The functional dependence of the rate on G r , the free energy change for the mineral reaction, is discussed, based on recent experimental work. An important result is the presence of a surface transition in the reaction mechanism leading to a very strong nonlinear dependence of the dissolution rates on G r . The possible role of dislocation defects in this surface transition is discussed. The relation of global weathering rates and geochemical cycles to the recent experimental and theoretical water-rock kinetic work is explored. The temperature effect on the silica content of streams is reevaluated. The variation of silica concentration with runoff in the rivers of the world is quantified, using a coupled fluid flow and reaction model and the full rate law developed for a proto-granite system by the kinetic experiments. Implications of the water-rock kinetic data for the current geochemical cycles models are discussed with especial emphasis on the link between physical weathering and chemical weathering.},

  Abstract                 = {Soil profiles are difficult to compare by statistical methods because sampling depths and intervals and the number of samples per profile may vary. This paper discusses a novel method for handling the problem. Chemical data from 52 soil profiles, which formed a chronosequence of podzols from Fraser Island, south-eastern Queensland, was classified using the Levenshtein metric. The soils varied from undifferentiated sands to deeply weathered podzols with many metres of bleached A, horizon. The data used were the proportions by weight in the soil samples of Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe and Al extracted by mild acid digests. A polythetic divisive program was used to form seven groups from a matrix of six attributes and 573 samples. These groups were used to code profiles into strings of digits whose length equalled the number of samples in a profile. The Levenshtein metric then formed these strings into a dissimilarity matrix, which in turn was used to produce groups by an agglomerative hierarchical procedure. The groups produced by this procedure were checked using discriminant function analysis applied to depth function parameters derived from the original data set used in the pattern analysis procedures. These parameters were derived from a model which is consistent with ideas of soil genesis, hence their use should favour a classification related to soil development. The classificatory procedure could also be weighted for the depth to the B horizon, a procedure that was considered to be a direct weighting for the degree of soil development. Discriminant function analysis showed that the groups produced could be discriminated on the basis of depth function parameters regardless of any depth weighting. The groups were consistent with the known geochronology, but contained an important component due to other factors such as parent material and surface accumulation due to plant activity. Classification involving the Levenshtein metric proved to be a sound means of taking adequate account of the variation present in the data. Supplementary procedures provided by TAXON enable fresh insights into the nature of the individuals and their interrelationships to be obtained.},

  Abstract                 = {There is a need for accurate, quantitative soil information for natural resource planning and management. This information shapes the way decisions are made as to how soil resources are assessed and managed. This paper proposes a novel method for whole-soil profile predictions (to 1 m) across user-defined study areas where limited soil information exists. Using the Edgeroi district in north-western NSW as the test site, we combined equal-area spline depth functions with digital soil mapping techniques to predict the vertical and lateral variations of carbon storage and available water capacity (AWC) across the 1500 km2 area. Neural network models were constructed for both soil attributes to model their relationship with a suite of environmental factors derived from a digital elevation model, radiometric data and Landsat imagery. Subsequent fits of the models resulted in an R2 of 44\% for both carbon and AWC. For validation at selected model depths, R2 values ranged between 20 and 27\% for carbon prediction (RMSE: 0.30‚Äì0.52 log (kg/m3)) and between 8 and 29\% for AWC prediction (RMSE: 0.01 m/m). Visually, reconstruction of splines at selected validation data points indicated an average fit with raw data values. In order to improve upon our model and validation results there is a need to address some of the structural and metrical uncertainties identified in this study. Nevertheless, the resulting geo-database of quantitative soil information describing its spatial and vertical variations is an example of what can be generated with this proposed methodology. We also demonstrate the functionality of this geo-database in terms of data enquiry for user-defined queries.},

  Abstract                 = {Ion exchange resins have widely been used in mineralization studies of organic materials. However, the stability of resin (anionic and cationic) under changing physical environmental conditions is not well known. Our objective was to evaluate N and P adsorption or desorption characteristics of resins exposed to freeze‚Äìthaw or dry‚Äìwet cycles. Mixed bed resins (1:1 oven-dry mass strong base anion A464-D and strong acid cation C-249) were subjected to 0, 1, and 30 freeze‚Äìthaw or dry‚Äìwet cycles. To accomplish the dry‚Äìwet cycles, fresh resin was kept in a forced-air oven at 25 (+/-2)C for 28 h and rewetted to initial moisture condition for 20 h. To accomplish the freeze‚Äìthaw cycle, fresh resin was frozen for 16 h and thawed to room temperature for 8 h daily. At the end of the freeze‚Äìthaw or dry‚Äìwet cycles, resin was equilibrated with 3.2 mM L‚Äì1 NH4‚ÄìN, 3.2 mM L‚Äì1 NO3‚ÄìN, or 0.97 mM L‚Äì1 PO4‚ÄìP for a period of 1 h. Dry‚Äìwet cycles induced desorption of N and P associated with shrinkage of resins and expulsion of interstitial liquid. At the highest dry‚Äìwet cycle, 3.3, 0.35, and 0.15\% of the total adsorbed PO4‚ÄìP, NH4‚ÄìN, and NO3‚ÄìN was desorbed, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the dry‚Äìwet or freeze‚Äìthaw cycles did not alter the physical integrity of these resins. Freeze‚Äìthaw cycles had no effects on N and P adsorption or desorption characteristics of resins of the specific resins used in this study. Ion exchange resins used for in situ nutrient monitoring should be screened using similar techniques to assess its adsorption and desorption stability and physical integrity to fluctuating environmental conditions. Resin types and stability should be mentioned when comparisons are made to other studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Knowledge of how surface roughness influences the reflectance of sunlight from cultivated soils is useful in various applications, such as estimating albedo values used as inputs to soil temperature models and erosion models. The albedos of two soils were studied for dry and wet surfaces with four different roughness conditions, changed from a reference smooth soil surface. The soils were the Gila fine sandy loam [coarse-loamy, mixed (calcareous), thermic Typic Torrifluvent] (Ap horizon), 10YR 6.0/3.2 dry and 10YR 4.1/3.3 wet, and the Pima clay loam [fine-silty, mixed (calcareous), thermic Typic Torrifluvent] (Ap horizon), 10YR 5.2/2.3 dry and 10YR 3.3/2.3 wet. Albedo measurements were made during selected mornings with clear skies in 1995 and 1996. The mean albedos of reference smooth surfaces (<2 mm sieved soil) were 0.279 and 0.155 for dry and wet Gila soil and 0.221 and 0.114 for dry and wet Pima soil. Four tillage conditions were studied: rough plow, disk, disk-disk, and seedbed. Tillage direction was north-south in 1995 and east-west in 1996. The goodness of fit of linear relationships determined between mean albedo and surface roughness, measured with a roughness meter and reported as the root mean square deviation, were relatively high; however, the slopes for the regression equations were different for the two soils and the two moisture conditions. The different slopes indicate that the sensitivity of albedo to surface roughness was highest for the most reflective surface (dry Gila soil) and lowest for the least reflective surface (wet Pima soil). The albedos were on average 27, 18, 10, and 8% lower for dry and wet rough-plow, disk, disk-disk, and seedbed treatments, respectively, as compared with the albedo of the reference smooth soil. These reduction percentages can be used as a general guide to estimate the albedos of tilled soils similar to the Gila and Pima soils studied here.},

  Abstract                 = {We review various recent approaches to making digital soil maps based on geographic information systems (GIS) data layers, note some commonalities and propose a generic framework for the future. We discuss the various methods that have been, or could be, used for fitting quantitative relationships between soil properties or classes and their &lsquo;environment&rsquo;. These include generalised linear models, classification and regression trees, neural networks, fuzzy systems and geostatistics. We also review the data layers that have been, or could be, used to describe the &lsquo;environment&rsquo;. Terrain attributes derived from digital elevation models, and spectral reflectance bands from satellite imagery, have been the most commonly used, but there is a large potential for new data layers. The generic framework, which we call the scorpan-SSPFe (soil spatial prediction function with spatially autocorrelated errors) method, is particularly relevant for those places where soil resource information is limited. It is based on the seven predictive scorpan factors, a generalisation of Jenny's five factors, namely: (1) s: soil, other or previously measured attributes of the soil at a point; (2) c: climate, climatic properties of the environment at a point; (3) o: organisms, including land cover and natural vegetation; (4) r: topography, including terrain attributes and classes; (5) p: parent material, including lithology; (6) a: age, the time factor; (7) n: space, spatial or geographic position. Interactions (*) between these factors are also considered. The scorpan-SSPFe method essentially involves the following steps: (i) Define soil attribute(s) of interest and decide resolution [rho] and block size [beta].(ii) Assemble data layers to represent Q.(iii) Spatial decomposition or lagging of data layers.(iv) Sampling of assembled data (Q) to obtain sampling sites.(v) GPS field sampling and laboratory analysis to obtain soil class or property data.(vi) Fit quantitative relationships (observing Ockham's razor) with autocorrelated errors.(vii) Predict digital map.(viii) Field sampling and laboratory analysis for corroboration and quality testing.(ix) If necessary, simplify legend or decrease resolution by returning to (i) or improve map by returning to (v).Finally, possible applications, problems and improvements are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Conventional survey methods have efficiencies in medium to low intensity survey because they use relationships between soil properties and more readily observable environmental features as a basis for mapping. However, the implicit predictive models are qualitative, complex and rarely communicated in a clear manner. The possibility of developing an explicit analogue of conventional survey practice suited to medium to low intensity surveys is considered. A key feature is the use of quantitative environmental variables from digital terrain analysis and airborne gamma radiometric remote sensing to predict the spatial distribution of soil properties. The use of these technologies for quantitative soil survey is illustrated using an example from the Bago and Maragle State Forests in southeastern Australia. A design-based, stratified, two-stage sampling scheme was adopted for the 50,000 ha area using digital geology, landform and climate as stratifying variables. The landform and climate variables were generated using a high resolution digital elevation model with a grid size of 25 m. Site and soil data were obtained from 165 sites. Regression trees and generalised linear models were then used to generate spatial predictions of soil properties using digital terrain and gamma radiometric survey data as explanatory variables. The resulting environmental correlation models generate spatial predictions with a fine grain unmatched by comparable conventional survey methods. Example models and spatial predictions are presented for soil profile depth, total phosphorus and total carbon. The models account for 42\%, 78\% and 54\% of the variance present in the sample respectively. The role of spatial dependence, issues of scale and landscape complexity are discussed along with the capture of expert knowledge. It is suggested that environmental correlation models may form a useful trend model for various forms of kriging if spatial dependence is evident in the residuals of the model.},

  Abstract                 = {Portable X-ray fluorescence (PXRF) spectrometry can provide rapid and nondestructive analyses of agriculturally important elements in soil. To assess the applicability of PXRF for total element analysis of Vertisols, 20 soils were collected across northern New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Comparison of PXRF results were made with conventional standard microwave aqua regia (AR) digestion followed by inductively couple plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP–OES) analysis, laboratory X-ray fluorescence (LXRF), and neutron activation analysis (NAA). Strong linear correlations were found for As, Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Ni, P, Pb, Si, Ti, and Zn. We demonstrate that nondestructive analyses for total soil element determination, particularly Ca, Fe, Mn, and P, should now allow rapid elucidation of important chemical processes in Vertisols that are commonly only available following rigorous sample preparation and digestion. The integrated and robust character of PXRF instrumentation, requiring minimal or no dedicated laboratory infrastructure, is readily adaptable to a wide range of analytical situations.},

Many geographic information systems are being developed that store topographic information as the primary data for analysing water resource and biological problems. Furthermore, topography can be used to develop more physically realistic structures for hydrologic and water quality models that directly account for the impact of topography on the hydrology. Digital elevation models are the primary data used in the analysis of catchment topography. We describe elevation data sources, digital elevation model structures, and the analysis of digital elevation data for hydrological, geomorphological, and biological applications. Some hydrologic models that make use of digital representations of topography are also considered.},

  Abstract                 = {Accurate solar irradiance data are not only of particular importance for the assessment of the radiative forcing of the climate system, but also absolutely necessary for efficient planning and operation of solar energy systems. Within the European project Heliosat-3, a new type of solar irradiance scheme is developed. This new type will be based on radiative transfer models (RTM) using atmospheric parameter information retrieved from the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite (clouds, ozone, water vapour) and the ERS-2/ENVISAT satellites (aerosols, ozone).This paper focuses on the description of the clear-sky module of the new scheme, especially on the integrated use of a radiative transfer model. The linkage of the clear-sky module with the cloud module is also briefly described in order to point out the benefits of the integrated RTM use for the all-sky situations. The integrated use of an RTM within the new Solar Irradiance Scheme SOLIS is applied by introducing a new fitting function called the modified Lambert-Beer (MLB) relation. Consequently, the modified Lambert-Beer relation and its role for an integrated RTM use are discussed. Comparisons of the calculated clear-sky irradiances with ground-based measurements and the current clear-sky module demonstrate the advantages and benefits of SOLIS. Since SOLIS can provide spectrally resolved irradiance data, it can be used for different applications. Beside improved information for the planning of solar energy systems, the calculation of photosynthetic active radiation, UV index, and illuminance is possible.},

  Abstract                 = {Parametric and non-parametric depth functions have been used to estimate continuous soil profile properties. However, some soil properties, such as those seen in weathered loess, have anisotropic peak-shaped depth distributions. These distributions are poorly handled by common parametric functions. And while nonparametric functions can handle this data they lack meaningful parameters to describe physical phenomena in the depth distribution of a property such as a peak, an inflection point, or a gradient. The objective of this work is to introduce the use of asymmetric peak functions to model complex and anisotropic soil property depth profiles. These functions have the advantages of providing parameters, which quantify or describe pedogenic processes. We demonstrate the application of the Pearson Type {IV} ({PIV}) and the logistic power peak ({LPP}) functions to high resolution soil property depth profiles measured by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy in a claypan soil landscape of Northeastern Missouri, {USA}. Both peak functions successfully fit clay, silt, and {pH} data for an example soil profile from a summit landscape position (R2 = 0.90 for {pH} and 0.98 for silt and clay). The {LPP} function was further demonstrated to fit clay depth distribution for a shoulder, backslope, footslope, and a depositional landscape position (R2 = 0.98, 0.96, 0.96, 0.91). Relationships between the fitted parameters of these profiles were useful to describe landscape trends in their morphological features and show promise to continuously describe pedogenic processes in three dimensions. Peak functions are a useful companion to high-resolution soil profile data collected by sensors and their combined use may allow more intensive mapping and better explanation of soil landscape variability.},

  Abstract                 = {The kinetic and thermodynamic properties of quartz, plagioclase, and K‐feldspars, which constitute 70 to 80% of the upper crust, provide a framework for prediction of mineralogical and chemical changes involved in the production of siliciclastic sediments. Chemical weathering of bedrock may produce weathering profiles with distinct mineralogical zones, compositionally much different from the parent rock. Mass wasting of such profiles produces sediments that reflect the mineralogy of the zones exposed to mechanical erosion, rather than the composition of fresh bedrock. The relative rates of chemical weathering and mechanical erosion determine which mineralogical zones are exposed to mass wasting, and therefore control the compositions of siliciclastic sediments. Stable rates of chemical weathering and erosion result in steady‐state weathering, so that thickness and the mineralogical composition of eroded soil zones, and therefore the mineralogy of derived sediments, remain unchanged while steady‐state weathering prevails. Non‐steady‐state weathering occurs where climate and tectonism vary. Changing conditions alter rates of chemical weathering and physical erosion, resulting in exposure of different, and sometimes all, weathering zones of profiles, or exposure of bedrock. Such conditions result in production of sediments with diverse mineralogy, reflecting incipiently‐to‐highly weathered zones of profiles. Steady‐ and non‐steady‐state weathering of granitic rocks therefore can be assessed by study of variations in quartz and feldspar contents of sands and variations in bulk compositions of muds, as shown for sediments derived from the Sierra Nevada and Bega batholiths, and the Appalachian Piedmont. Compositional variation of sediments, or its absence, are controlled by the relative rates of chemical weathering and erosion and provides insight into climatic and tectonic conditions in source lands, as well as information about provenance composition.},

Imposing the limits of soil taxonomy that circumscribe soils from without frequently divides natural soil bodies, i.e., collections of recurring contiguous pedons that are more similar to each other than they are to adjacent soils. We used the pedon data for six soil series to explore causes and alternatives to placement of pedons as taxadjuncts. Eight to 11 pedons per series were identified in the field, and sampled. Of the total of 56 pedons, 59% were taxadjuncts. We tried the two common approaches to handling these: (i) ignore misses that are just outside the limits of taxonomic criteria, or (ii) attribute near misses to errors in precision, which assumes that the error is not normally distributed. Neither approach is valid nor eliminates all of the taxadjuncts. We considered (i) dropping the seires as a taxonomic category, (ii) adopting the cartographic series proposed by Knox, or (iii) classifying the central concept of the series but allowing characteristics to range across the limits between two families, or between two classes of any higher category. We propose option iii because, if accepted, (i) natural soil bodies would not be subdivided by artificial boundaries, (ii) soil taxonomy would be retained to facilitate technology transfer, (iii) the USDA-SCS prohibition against publishing data for taxadjuncts in soil survey reports would be nullified, and (iv) the exchange of information about the use and management of series would be facilitated.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper examines the robustness of various multivariate ordination methods applied to elucidate the relationship between soil developed on hillslope and the environment in a South Australian subcatchment. Canonical correspondence analyses were found to be less attractive than the linear methods (i.e., principal component analysis and redundancy analysis) because interrelations among soil variables and/or between soil and the landform attributes are more linear than unimodal. Among the linear methods, standard redundancy analysis following transformation of soil data gave a clearer insight into pedogenetic implications of soil-landform interactions. Gradient angle, plan convexity, profile convexity and to a lesser extent, upslope distance and area, account for much of the soil variation in the study area. Gradient influences the distribution of surficial soil particles which is suggestive of selective removal and deposition of fine materials on the mid- to lower-slopes. Higher subsoil clay percentage associated with concave slopes may be ascribed to either increased weathering rate and/or flux of fine material due to convergence of water flows. Solum depth and depth to bedrock also appeared to have controlled some of the contemporary pedo-geomorphological processes. Eluvio-illuvial processes are more pronounced in the relatively deep lower-slope pedons evidenced by cutans in their subsoil layers. Soil colours are related to the soil depth attributes, slope and upslope distance and area, probably through the influence of these attributes on soil drainage condition. The extent to which landform and parent-material related attributes (e.g., depth to bedrock) affect soil development and distribution patterns in the study area is shown quantitatively. These findings have considerably improved our understanding of soil genesis in the study area and also point to the importance of land unit delineation to design sampling patterns. The enhanced sampling design would be beneficial in terms of reduced extrapolation error and thus misclassification of soil.},

Soil was sampled along four 30-m transects and in 39 points within the study area. Textural fraction contents, bulk density, and water retention at 0, 2.5, 5.0, 10, 33, 100, 500, and 1500 kPa were measured in samples taken from 4- to 10-cm depth. A 30-m digital elevation model (DEM) was constructed from aerial photography data. Slopes, profile curvatures, and tangential curvatures were computed in grid nodes and interpolated to the sampling locations. Regressions with spatially correlated errors were used to relate water retention and texture to computed topographic variables. Sand, silt, and clay contents depended on slope and curvatures. Soil water retention at 10 and 33 kPa correlated with sand and silt contents. The regression model relating water retention to the topographic variables explained more than 60% of variation in soil water content at 10 and 33 kPa, and only 20% of variation at 100 kPa. Increases in slope values and decreases in tangential curvature values, i.e., less concavity or more convexity across the slope, led to the decreases in water retention at 10 and 33 kPa. Results of this work show a potential for topographic variables to be used in interpretation of field-scale variability of soil properties and, possibly, yield maps in precision agriculture.},

These space-borne observations have established conclusively that total solar irradiance changes over a wide range of periodicities--from minutes to the 11-year solar cycle. Since the total energy flux of the Sun is the principal driver for all Earths atmospheric phenomena, the accurate knowledge of the solar radiation received by the Earth and its variations is an extremely important issue. In this paper we review the long-term variations of total solar irradiance during solar cycles 21 and 22. We conclude that, within the current accuracy and precision of the measurements, the minimum level of total solar irradiance is about the same for both solar cycles 21 and 22.},

  Abstract                 = {This study aims to identify process-response relationships between pedogeomorphological processes and the spatial distribution of soil properties on a hillslope. Thirty-two physical and chemical attributes of 502 soil samples collected from 64 soil profiles on a hillslope in Somerset, UK, were analyzed using an ordination technique. Five factors explaining 80% of the total variation were first identified. Each factor was then regressed with terrain attributes to examine the influence of hillslope geomorphometry on soil distributions. Two-way ANOVA was used to separate the total variance of individual soil properties into vertical and lateral components, and the results were compared with the results of the ordination. The five factors were interpreted as demonstrating the effects of podzolization, nutrient dynamics, Mn leaching, erosion weathering, and soil acidification. The ability to predict soil properties over the landscape using terrain information varies widely among soil properties measured. In general, topsoil properties are better correlated with terrain attributes than subsoil properties. Contemporary pedological and geomorphological processes are most active in the surface horizon, which results in clear lateral differentiation of soil properties. For subsurface soils, only those few soil properties that showed a clear spatial pattern could be successfully modeled using terrain attributes. This research demonstrates that clear differences in the spatial distribution of individual soil properties are mainly determined by differential involvement in in situ pedogenesis and lateral slope processes. Future soil-landscape modeling attempts should pay more attention to the selection of soil properties and the interpretation of statistical results in relation to process-response dynamics.},

  Abstract                 = {The composition and structure of the annual vegetation beneath isolated live oak (Quercus agrifolia) canopies differed considerably from the surrounding annual grasslands. The grasslands were strongly dominated by Avena fatua. Beneath the live oaks, the dominants were the forb, Pholistoma auritum, and an important grassland species, Bromus diandrus. The environment beneath the live oak canopies was characterized by reduced light, increased levels of essential mineral nutrients and soil moisture, and moderation of temperature extremes compared to the grassland. A reciprocal transplant study, manipulating the dominant annual species and soil types, indicated that light levels and soil nutrients were significant factors in the differential distribution of the annuals. Competition for nutrients between the two grasses did not account for their differential distribution. While most factors contributed to the distributional changes in annual species, decreases in light levels caused by the live oak canopy had the greatest effect.},

  Abstract                 = {Rapid population growth and increasing urban demand reduce the availability of water for agriculture in Florida. The water-holding capacity of sandy soils in the Central Florida Ridge area is very poor (<0.10 m3 m-3). Improved soil water monitoring probes can help growers manage irrigation more efficiently and conserve water. This study evaluated a new soil water probe (ECH2O EC-5 sensor, Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA) in terms of probe-to-probe signal variability, response to fertilizer-induced salinity, and changes in soil temperature, soil volume sampled, sensitivity to pockets of air or dry soil, and performance in the field. Results were compared with an earlier version of a Decagon probe, the EC-20. Results indicated that the new probe has several advantages. The EC-5 was not sensitive to salinity or temperature fluctuations. Probe output change was almost zero when the salinity of the soil was increased by adding fertilizer to a soluble solids concentration of 14 g kg-1. When temperature was changed gradually from 3 to [~]38{degrees}C, probe output increased by only about 1%. Soil volume sampled by the probe was about 15 cm3. The change in probe response was negligible when soil cores up to 0.95 cm in diameter near the probe surface were removed. Probes responded well to changes in soil water content in the field. The EC-5 probe output increased noticeably when bulk density was increased from 1.1 to 1.6 Mg m-3. Probe-to-probe output signal and response to bulk density variations can affect the estimation of field water content unless necessary correction factors are utilized. These probes can be useful for monitoring soil water movement, estimating soil water content, and scheduling irrigation.},

  Abstract                 = {Establishing relationships between species distributions and environmental characteristics is a major goal in the search for forces driving species distributions. Canonical ordinations such as redundancy analysis and canonical correspondence analysis are invaluable tools for modeling communities through environmental predictors. They provide the means for conducting direct explanatory analysis in which the association among species can be studied according to their common and unique relationships with the environmental variables and other sets of predictors of interest, such as spatial variables. Variation partitioning can then be used to test and determine the likelihood of these sets of predictors in explaining patterns in community structure. Although variation partitioning in canonical analysis is routinely used in ecological analysis, no effort has been reported in the literature to consider appropriate estimators so that comparisons between fractions or, eventually, between different canonical models are meaningful. In this paper, we show that variation partitioning as currently applied in canonical analysis is biased. We present appropriate unbiased estimators. In addition, we outline a statistical test to compare fractions in canonical analysis. The question addressed by the test is whether two fractions of variation are significantly different from each other. Such assessment provides an important step toward attaining an understanding of the factors patterning community structure. The test is shown to have correct Type I error rates and good power for both redundancy analysis and canonical correspondence analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {Several recent theories and conceptual frameworks in pedology, ecology, geomorphology, and evolutionary biology, taken together, suggest the notion that earth's soils are not just strongly influenced by biota, but represent selective pressures. These ideas point in the direction of many aspects of soils as expressions of the effects of genes through the effects of organisms (i.e., extended phenotypes). The cumulative, interacting, overlapping effects of these extended phenotypes as manifested in the soil represent an extended composite phenotype. If this is the case, then we should expect major changes in biological evolution to be reflected in major changes in the types of soils. A brief review of paleopedology literature supports the notion of coevolution of soils and biota, not just in the sense of both responding to the same environmental forcings, but also with respect to explicit pedological expressions of biological change. The extended composite phenotype notion also suggests that significant biological changes should be reflected in significant qualitative pedological changes (i.e., fundamental changes in soil morphology beyond quantitative changes in specific short-lived soil properties). This is demonstrated via recent research in the Ouachita Mountains, Arkansas, where changes in selective pressures on trees associated with fire frequency are linked to changes in soil morphology. The concept of soils as extended composite phenotypes has repercussions for pedology, evolutionary biology, and interpretations of soils in other earth and environmental sciences. The notion of genetic signatures in soil morphology also has implications for the search for extraterrestrial life, and extends the notion of Earth as a set of tightly-coupled, densely interwoven systems.},

  Abstract                 = {The albedo of earth surface features, such as soil, is an important component of models that define land-surface meteorological processes. If land surfaces have no vegetative cover, soil properties determine the amount of solar radiation absorbed or reflected. We evaluated the influence of two soil properties, soil color and soil moisture, on soil albedo. Two soil moisture conditions were studied, air dry and wet, defined as the condition when the water films are absorbed by the soil and no water glistens on the soil surface. The albedos for 26 U.S. soils were measured with an Eppley pyranometer, which integrates radiant energy in wavelengths between 0.3 to 2.8 {micro}m. Soil colors were measured with a Minolta Chroma Meter and spectral reflectance curves from 0.45 to 0.9 {micro}m (measured in 0.1-{micro}m increments) were determined with a multispectral radiometer. All measurements were made on <2-mm smooth soil surfaces, and the dry and wet data were combined for statistical analyses. Soil albedos were significantly correlated with Munsell soil color value [IMG]f1.gif" BORDER="0"> , blue [IMG]f2.gif" BORDER="0"> , green [IMG]f3.gif" BORDER="0"> , red [IMG]f1.gif" BORDER="0"> , near infrared (NIR), [IMG]f4.gif" BORDER="0"> , and sum of the four bands [IMG]f5.gif" BORDER="0"> ; however, the slopes and intercepts for these relationships were different. The 52 spectral curves yielded nine cluster groups, which mostly related to the Munsell soil color value and soil albedo soil characteristics. The 0.3- to 2.8-{micro}m albedos of smoothed soils can be accurately estimated using the regression relationship: soil albedo (0.3-2.8 {micro}m) = 0.069 (color value) - 0.114. Using the regression equations presented here, spectral reflectance data in selected visible and NIR bands can also be used to predict albedo.},

  Abstract                 = {Large earthen-walled lysimeters at the San Dimas Experimental Forest in southern California present a unique opportunity to assess vegetation effects on biogeochemical processes and cation release by weathering in controlled soil-vegetation systems where archived samples of soil parent material are available for comparison. The lysimeters were filled in 1937 with homogenized fine sandy loam derived on site from the weathering of diorite, and planted in 1946 with scrub oak (Quercus dumosa) and Coulter pine (Pinus coulteri). Changes in base cation contents were measured in above-ground biomass, and total and exchangeable soil pools to a depth of 1 meter. All cations in the non-exchangeable soil pool decreased relative to the initial fill material, indicating release by weathering. Sodium and K were depleted from both exchangeable and non-exchangeable pools of the soils. Plant uptake of Na was minimal, whereas K storage in vegetation exceeded the loss from the exchangeable soil pool. In both soil-vegetation systems, but especially for oak, there was an increase in exchangeable Ca and Mg. For all base cations, storage in above-ground biomass was greater for oak, whereas losses by weathering from the non-exchangeable soil pool were greater under pine. Strong evidence supports biocycling as a controlling mechanism resulting in greater Ca and Mg release by weathering under pine. In addition, decreases in non-exchangeable Ca and Mg were strongly correlated to decrease in Si under oak, whereas no correlation was observed under pine. We conclude that weathering reactions or stoichiometry differed between vegetation types.},

The analysis of the solar data, which were appropriately selected at constant solar elevations, proves that the atmospheric transparency coefficient decreases with decreasing relative atmospheric mass. This fact leads to a virtual increase of Linke&rsquo;s turbidity factor with increasing solar elevation. Real diurnal and annual variations of the atmospheric turbidity are found, with a summer afternoon maximum and a winter morning minimum. The correlation between atmospheric turbidity and specific humidity shows that the summer maximum is due to the heavy water vapour content of maritime air masses, carried by the west-southwestern winds prevalent during this season. Continental dust particles, carried by the east-northeastern winds, growing due to water vapours result in high turbidity at the end of summer. The winter minimum is caused by a considerable decrease of the humidity and dust content of the continental air masses, carried by strong east-northeastern winds, prevalent during the cold period. Correlations of atmospheric turbidity with specific humidity and of diffuse radiation with atmospheric turbidity for maritime and continental air masses are derived.},

  Abstract                 = {Basalt rocks occupy substantial land area and play a significant role in global weathering patterns and biogeochemical cycling. The objective of this research was to quantify climatic controls of weathering and pedogenic processes on basalt-derived soils across an environmental gradient on the western slope of the Casacade Range of California, USA. We hypothesized that climate controls mineral neogenesis, with cool, moist conditions favoring formation of short-range-order (SRO) materials and warm, dry conditions favoring smectite, crystalline Fe-oxyhydroxides and kaolins. Four pedons were sampled across an elevation gradient (250–2500 m) having large variation in mean annual soil temperature (5–17 °C) and mean annual precipitation (750–1350 mm). The soil mineral assemblage was characterized by X-ray diffraction, selective dissolution, total elemental analysis and light microscopy. The degree of weathering and mineral assemblage exhibited a clear threshold at the permanent winter snowline (~ 1200 m). Maximum soil development was noted just below the snowline with soils dominated by kaolinite and dehydrated halloysite, crystalline Fe-oxyhydroxides (48 kg m− 2), extensive loss of cations (chemical index of alteration, CIA > 95%) and clay accumulation (447 kg m− 2). In contrast, the high elevation snow-dominated pedons displayed less intense weathering (e.g., CIA < 75% and clay < 25 kg m− 2) and a mineral assemblage dominated by primary minerals and SRO materials. The cool, moist conditions of mid-altitude (~ 1600 m) soils appear optimum for the formation and preservation of SRO materials (allophane = 30 kg m− 2). All pedons contained hydroxy-Al interlayered smectite that was either neogenic or derived from eolian minerals. With increasing elevation soil development followed Alfisols → Ultisols → Andisols → Entisols, in agreement with similar gradients in the California Sierra Nevada. Weathering, mineralogical transformations and soil development are limited by water availability at low elevations, whereas low soil temperature is the major limitation at high elevations.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a model for prediction of pedogenic environments and soil properties based on energy input to the soil system. The model estimates rates of precipitation and net primary production (NPP) energy input using the Parameter-Regression Independent Slope Model (PRISM) climate data, and a parent material index (PMI). Soil order, soil C, and clay data from the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) database were compared with rates of NPP and precipitation energy input for major geographic regions of the continental USA, including California, Oregon, Washington, Texas, North Dakota, Alabama, Pennsylvania, and New Hampshire. Soil orders in all states show differences in total energy input (E in, kJ m−2yr−1) and the percentage of E in from NPP (\%E npp) (e.g., Ultisols E in = 29915, \%E npp = 49\%; Mollisols E in = 5880, \%E npp = 90\%). Using linear regression models, rates of NPP estimated (R 2 = 0.82***) trends in soil C content in western states, but failed to estimate soil C in other geographic areas. Parent material index adjusted energy flux estimated soil clay content for the majority (99.5\%) of igneous parent materials in California and Oregon (R 2 = 0.67**), the only states with digital geologic data. The model underestimated clay content in steeply sloping Inceptisols and Andisols (0.5\% of igneous land area). Results suggest that rates of NPP may be used to estimate soil C for climate regimes with steep environmental gradients. Landscape age and stability components might improve clay prediction in young and erosive landscapes. Modeled energy input provides a tool for estimating pedogenic environments, soil order, and soil properties. Energy input parameters may aid efforts to pre-map broad landscape units for soil survey.},

  Abstract                 = {It is impractical to measure water retention for large-scale hydrologic, agronomic, and ecological applications or at the design stages of many projects; therefore, water retention estimates are often used. Field soil descriptions routinely include structure and consistence characterization. The objective of this work was to use the National Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) database to evaluate the potential for structural and consistence properties to serve as predictors of soil hydraulics properties. Total of {approx}2140 samples were found that had (i) values of water contents at -33 kPa and -1500 kPa, (ii) structure characterized with grade, size, and shape, (iii) consistence characterized with dry and moist consistency, stickiness, and plasticity, and (iv) textural class determined in the field and from lab textural analysis. Because structural and consistence parameters were represented by categories rather than numbers, regression trees were used for recursive partitioning of the data sets into groups to decrease overall variability measured as the sum of squared errors within groups. Plasticity class, grade class, and dry consistency class were leading predictors of water retention at both -33 kPa and -1500 kPa matric potentials. The accuracy of estimates from structural and consistence parameters was lower than from textural classes. Using soil structural and consistence parameters along with textural classes provided a small, although significant improvement in accuracy of water retention estimates as compared with estimation from texture alone. Soil structural and consistence parameters can serve as predictors of soil water retention because those parameters reflect soil basic properties that affect soil hydraulic properties.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a clear-sky model, which has been developed in the framework of the new digital European Solar Radiation Atlas (ESRA). This ESRA model is described and analysed with the main objective of being used to estimate solar radiation at ground level from satellite images with the Heliosat method. Therefore it is compared to clear-sky models that have already been used in the Heliosat method. The diffuse clear-sky irradiation estimated by this ESRA model and by other models has been also checked against ground measurements, for different ranges of the Linke turbidity factor and solar elevation. The results show that the ESRA model is the best one with respect to robustness and accuracy. The r.m.s. error in the estimation of the hourly diffuse irradiation ranges from 11 Wh m-2 to 35 Wh m-2 for diffuse irradiation up to 250 Wh m-2. The good results obtained with such a model are due to the fact that it takes into account the Linke turbidity factor and the elevation of the site, two factors that influence the incoming solar radiation. In return, it implies the knowledge of these factors at each pixel of the satellite image for the application of the Heliosat method.},

  Abstract                 = {This article presents the method Heliosat-2 that converts observations made by geostationary meteorological satellites into estimates of the global irradiation at ground level. This new version integrates the knowledge gained by various exploitations of the original method Heliosat and its varieties in a coherent and thorough way. It is based upon the same physical principles but the inputs to the method are calibrated radiances, instead of the digital counts output from the sensor. This change opens the possibilities of using known models of the physical processes in atmospheric optics, thus removing the need for empirically defined parameters and of pyranometric measurements to tune them. The ESRA models are used for modeling the clear-sky irradiation. The assessment of the ground albedo and the cloud albedo is based upon explicit formulations of the path radiance and the transmittance of the atmosphere. The method Heliosat-2 is applied to Meteosat images of Europe for the months of January 1995, April 1995 and July 1994. Pyranometric measurements performed by thirty-five meteorological stations are used to assess the performances that are close to those of Heliosat-1 found in the literature. Possible improvements are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {The observation of low dielectric values <2, consistent with the bright areas of the surface of Mars, is completely counter to expectation for soils dominated by mafic minerals, especially Fe minerals and pyroxenes that tend to have dielectric values two to three times higher than quartz, which has a value of 4.7. To this day, this observation has not been explained. The recent success of the Phoenix lander in locating water on Mars, however, is renewing interest in the use of sensors to determine Martian soil properties. We took measurements on the Hawaiian JSC Mars-1 soil simulant, considered to reflect the properties of the soils of the bright regions of Mars. Our objective was to determine if soil structure and dielectric phase configuration could account for low dielectric responses. We discovered that low dielectric values can be reconciled with mafic, Fe-bearing silicate mineralogy due to the presence of a palagonite structure with internal porosity. Furthermore, dielectric response as a function of water content is startlingly lower than standard soil calibration equations from Earth, meaning that the application of these equations may significantly underestimate water content determined from dielectric measurements--not because of "bound water," but because of the altered dielectric phase configuration due to the palagonite internal pore structure. The implications of this finding for future planetary missions are that all sensors relying on interpreting soil properties from measurements of bulk soil electrical, thermal, or dielectric properties will be similarly affected in the presence of materials with internal porosity.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding the spatial and temporal variation in soil temperatures is important to classification, land use, and management. To that end, mean annual soil temperature (MAST) data for Wisconsin and Michigan were modeled to (i) determine the effects of the Great Lakes and their snowbelts on soil temperatures, and (ii) better estimate the location of the boundary between the mesic and frigid soil temperature regimes in this region. The location of the mesic-frigid (M-F) line is particularly difficult to determine where east-west gradients in air temperature cross north-south trends in snowfall due to Lake Michigan. Additionally, the soil temperature regime of several Great Lakes' peninsulas near the M-F line is in question. To determine the accuracy of our soil temperature model, soil temperature data output from it were compared with data derived from thermocouples implanted in soils at 39 sites in northern Michigan that had been collecting data several times daily for more than 6 yr. Error statistics for the model show that it has essentially no mean bias when examined on an annual basis or for winter, and only a bias of 0.1{degrees}C for the warm season. The M-F line in Wisconsin and Michigan is slightly north of most previously estimated locations, and is strongly influenced by the snowbelt in southern Michigan. Soils in deep snow areas stay warmer in winter than do soils inland, increasing their MAST and forcing the M-F line north of where air temperatures alone might have placed it. Lake-effect areas also stay cold longer into the spring season, and cool down more slowly in fall. Soil temperatures in these areas are, therefore, more moderated on an annual basis, as indicated by coefficients of variation.},

  Abstract                 = {Colors are widely used to describe soil profiles but seldom to identify minerals. This study was conducted to determine whether color measurements with a colorimeter could be employed to identify Fe oxides and hydroxysulfates, either as monomineralic samples or in soils. We measured the color of 277 Fe oxide and hydroxysulfate mineral samples, as well as 309 soils and soil fractions. Discriminant analysis was employed to separate the minerals in three different color systems: CIE-Yxy, CIE-L*a*b*, and Munsell. Using the color of monomineralic samples, 100% of maghemites and jarosites could be correctly classified, 95% of goethites, 90% of feroxyhites, 84% of lepidocrocites, 83% of hematites, 56% of ferrihydrites, 50% of akaganeites, and 44% of schwertmannites. In soil samples, goethite (90% correct classifications) could be reliably distinguished from hematite-goethite mixtures (82% correct classifications), and from lepidocrocite-goethite mixtures (89%). The identification of ferrihydrites, akaganeites, and schwertmannites largely failed because of similar average colors and because of high color variability. Because the color variability is a mineral-intrinsic property rather than produced by errors of measurement, color is in principle unsuited for identifying ferrihydrites, akaganeites, and schwertmannites. However, color may be used to identify goethite, hematite, lepidocrocite, jarosite, maghemite, and feroxyhite with a relatively high reliability. The choice of color system is not crucial for this type of analysis.},

We compared soil classification and spatial differentiation of a landscape dominated by sodic soils. Both statistical methodologies and standard soil-survey techniques were used to differentiate soils. Forty-nine pedons at three landform positions were compared with canonical discriminant analysis, principal component analysis, and kriging. Statistical analyses improved soil classification and allowed a clearer view of the field distribution of soil properties, compared with standard soil-survey techniques. Soils with properties indicative of strong leaching (Solods) are recognized as significantly different from other soil taxonomic components at the intermediate and wetland positions. Solods were extensive at the wetland position, but could not be differentiated from Typic Natraquolls solely by morphologic observation. Although Solods are related to other leached soils, Argiaquolls and Argialbolls, they also possess soil properties that are similar to associated sodic soils. Leptic Natriborolls and Udic Natriborolls were similar except for salinity. The salinity difference by itself does not produce significant statistical differentiation between the soils of the two natric subgroups. High salinity would be better recognized as a soil-series phase, not a separate subgroup of Natriboroll.},

  Abstract                 = {Methods for rapid estimation of soil properties are needed for quantitative assessments of land management problems. We developed a scheme for development and use of soil spectral libraries for rapid nondestructive estimation of soil properties based on analysis of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. A diverse library of over 1000 archived topsoils from eastern and southern Africa was used to test the approach. Air-dried soils were scanned using a portable spectrometer (0.35-2.5 {micro}m) with an artificial light source. Soil properties were calibrated to soil reflectance using multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and screening tests were developed for various soil fertility constraints using classification trees. A random sample of one-third of the soils was withheld for validation purposes. Validation r2 values for regressions were: exchangeable Ca, 0.88; effective cation-exchange capacity (ECEC), 0.88; exchangeable Mg, 0.81; organic C concentration, 0.80; clay content, 0.80; sand content, 0.76; and soil pH, 0.70. Validation likelihood ratios for diagnostic screening tests were: ECEC <4.0 cmolc kg-1, 10.8; pH <5.5, 5.6; potential N mineralization >4.1 mg kg-1 d-1, 2.9; extractable P <7 mg kg-1, 2.9; exchangeable K <0.2 cmolc kg-1, 2.6. We show the response of prediction accuracy to sample size and demonstrate how the predictive value of spectral libraries can be iteratively increased through detection of spectral outliers among new samples. The spectral library approach opens up new possibilities for modeling, assessment and management of risk in soil evaluations in agricultural, environmental, and engineering applications. Further research should test the use of soil reflectance in pedotransfer functions for prediction of soil functional attributes.},

  Abstract                 = {Streamflow generation in semiarid Mediterranean environments is governed by the timing and amount of precipitation. Although topography is widely considered a dominant factor controlling the delivery of water to streams, we hypothesized that antecedent soil moisture and soil stratigraphy regulates the vertical dimension of hydrologic flowpaths and streamflow generation in a headwater catchment of the Sierra Foothill Region in California. We monitored soil moisture, subsurface lateral flow, streamflow, and meteorological conditions in a 33-ha catchment to study the linkage between hydrologic flowpaths in soil and streamflow characteristics. A total of 100 soil profiles were instrumented with soil moisture sensors at four depths in A, AB, Bt1, and 2Btss horizons. A hillslope perched-water collection system was used to measure subsurface lateral flow from these same horizons using tipping buckets. Streamflow was monitored using a V-notch weir for low flows and Parshall flume for high flows. Integrated hydrologic measurements show a close synchrony between streamflow and subsurface lateral flow in AB and Bt horizons overlying a hydraulically restrictive claypan (2Btss horizon). The thickness of the perched water table controlled the magnitude of subsurface lateral flow, which was greatest when AB horizons became saturated. Stream recession characteristics were controlled by lateral flow in less permeable horizons (Bt) directly overlying the claypan. Through the course of the water year, subsurface lateral flow from near surface horizons (A and AB) increased as antecedent soil moisture and thickness of the perched water table increased catchment-wide. The dynamic nature of hydrologic flowpaths in this system has implications for water quality as water is short-circuited to the stream through upper soil horizons. This study highlights the need for a detailed understanding of soil stratigraphic relationships to fully understand and model streamflow and water quality dynamics in semiarid soils with strongly contrasting physical properties.},

  Abstract                 = {Biotite-induced disintegration of granite fragments in the soils of plant communities on the slopes of Panola Mountain proceeds rapidly during the early stages of plant succession. Complete disintegration of some fragments may take over 670 years. The grain size of the minerals in the plant community soils is strongly influenced by the size distributions of the minerals in the parent rock, taking into account fracturing of polycrystalline quartz into monocrystalline grains. The grain size distribution of these monocrystalline quartz grains is bimodal in the Panola granite and in the plant community soils during the later stages of plant succession.},

  Abstract                 = {Long-term weathering rates (RLT) were determined from base cation depletion in soil profiles developed on six granitic glacial moraines varying in age from 0.4 to [&ge;]297 ka in the Wind River Mountains, Wyoming. Weathering rates were found to decrease with soil age (t) according to the power-law equation RLT = 15 [c] t (-0.71) where RLT is in meq [c] m -2 [c] yr -1, and t is in ka. Comparable data from the literature are consistent with this function, and it is similar to power-law equations describing changes in laboratory weathering rates with time. On the basis of our study, we predict that for a catchment unaffected by anthropogenic inputs and in a steady state with respect to the organic and cation exchange pools, RLT should be higher than present-day weathering rates derived from stream fluxes (RPD) by a factor of about 3.4.},

  Abstract                 = {Soil depth is an important input parameter in hydrological and ecological modeling. Presently, the soil depth data available in national soil databases (STATSGO and SSURGO) from the Natural Resources Conservation Service are provided as averages within generalized land units (map units). Spatial uncertainty within these units limits their applicability for distributed modeling in complex terrain. This work reports statistical models for prediction of soil depth in a semiarid mountainous watershed that are based upon the relationship between soil depth and topographic and land cover attributes. Soil depth was surveyed by driving a rod into the ground until refusal at locations selected to represent the topographic and land cover variation in the Dry Creek Experimental Watershed near Boise, Idaho. The soil depth survey consisted of a model calibration set, measured at 819 locations over 8 subwatersheds representing topographic and land cover variability and a model testing set, measured at 130 more broadly distributed locations in the watershed. Many model input variables were developed for regression to the field data. Topographic attributes were derived from a digital elevation model. Land cover attributes were derived from Landsat remote sensing images and high-resolution aerial photographs. Generalized additive and random forests models were developed to predict soil depth over the watershed. They were able to explain about 50% of the soil depth spatial variation, which is an important improvement over the soil depth extracted from the SSURGO national soil database.},

  Abstract                 = {Soil grid data were gathered from 156 points in the 30-ha Muizen forest (Ranst, Belgium). At each grid point, soil profiles were examined morphologically by augering to 120-cm depth. In the laboratory, pH(KCl) was determined on samples from every horizon. To allow numerical analyses, all the morphological attributes were given ordinal scores. The analysis consisted of two parts. First, the master horizons were split up into subtypes using Principal Components Analysis and a non-hierarchical clustering technique. This was necessary to overcome the problem of the anisotropy of the soil profiles, which makes it impossible to pool the data of all the horizons and analyse them together. Next, the distinguished horizon subtypes were used as input for the continuous soil profile classification with the &lsquo;fuzzy k-means with extragrades&rsquo; algorithm.Five different soil classes plus an extragrade class were distinguished. The distinguished soil classes exhibited a fair degree of spatial autocorrelation and correlated well with the Belgian Soil Map.The technique developed ensures the compatibility with national or global soil classification systems based on diagnostic horizons and properties on the one hand and the production of high-resolution soil classes for local use on the other. Furthermore, the developed technique allows reanalysis and optimisation of data from previous surveys.},

  Abstract                 = {Soil respiration (Rs) is an important source of CO2 to the atmosphere, yet understanding the processes controlling the combined autotrophic and heterotrophic components has proven challenging. Numerous statistical models have been developed to explain Rs as a function of physical and chemical conditions, but there has been little effort to systematically evaluate and compare the performance of these different models. Soils in a sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) forest were monitored for Rs and its physical and chemical drivers, and the monitored data were used to fit the most common of these statistical models. Each model was fit using a repeated trials approach and the performance of the model was evaluated with a range of goodness-of-fit measures (RMSE, mean absolute error, r2, index of agreement, bias, and Akaike information criterion). An exponential model in which the exponent is a polynomial expression that is linear with respect to temperature ({degrees}C) and quadratic with respect to soil moisture (% by volume) explained 57% of the variance in Rs and performed well among the goodness-of-fit measures. Inclusion of C quantity and substrate quality (as measured by the C/N ratio) in the soils, however, increased the explanation of variance in Rs to 71%. This study shows that combining soil temperature and moisture drivers with soil C quantity and substrate quality significantly improves statistical models predicting soil respiration. Our findings support the comparison of the performance of different statistical models using a repeated trials approach coupled with a range of goodness-of-fit measures to identify controls on Rs within an ecosystem and to assess the generality of these controls on Rs across ecosystems.},

  Abstract                 = {We analyze the degree of spatial organization of soil moisture and the ability of terrain attributes to predict that organization. By organization we mean systematic spatial variation or consistent spatial patterns. We use 13 observed spatial patterns of soil moisture, each based on over 500 point measurements, from the 10.5 ha Tarrawarra experimental catchment in Australia. The measured soil moisture patterns exhibit a high degree of organization during wet periods owing to surface and subsurface lateral redistribution of water. During dry periods there is little spatial organization. The shape of the distribution function of soil moisture changes seasonally and is influenced by the presence of spatial organization. Generally, it is quite different from the shape of the distribution functions of various topographic indices. A correlation analysis found that ln(a), where a is the specific upslope area, was the best univariate spatial predictor of soil moisture for wet conditions and that the potential radiation index was best during dry periods. Combinations of ln(a) or ln(a/tan(Î²)), where Î² is the surface slope, and the potential solar radiation index explain up to 61% of the spatial variation of soil moisture during wet periods and up to 22% during dry periods. These combinations explained the majority of the topographically organized component of the spatial variability of soil moisture a posteriori. A scale analysis indicated that indices that represent terrain convergence (such as ln(a) or ln(a/tan(Î²))) explain variability at all scales from 10 m up to the catchment scale and indices that represent the aspect of different hillslopes (such as the potential solar radiation index) explain variability at scales from 80 m to the catchment scale. The implications of these results are discussed in terms of the organizing processes and in terms of the use of terrain attributes in hydrologic modeling and scale studies. A major limitation on the predictive power of terrain indices is the degree of spatial organization present in the soil moisture pattern at the time for which the prediction is made.},

Stream solute concentrations are strongly correlated with proportional ET loss, and evaporative concentration makes stream solute concentrations an inappropriate surrogate for chemical weathering. Chemical fluxes are unaffected by ET, and SiO2 and Na weathering fluxes exhibit systematic increases with precipitation, runoff, and temperature. However, warm and wet watersheds produce anomalously rapid weathering rates. A proposed model that provides an improved prediction of weathering rates over climatic extremes Os the product of linear precipitation and Arrhenius temperature functions. The resulting apparent activation energies based on SiO2 and Na fluxes are 59.4 and 62.5 kJ sigma mol-1, respectively. The coupling between temperature and precipitation emphasizes the importance of tropical regions On global silicate weathering fluxes, and suggests it is not representative to use continental averages for temperature and precipitation On the weathering rate functions of global carbon cycling and climatic change models. Fluxes of K, Ca, and Mg exhibit no climatic correlation, implying that other processes, such as ion exchange, nutrient cycling, and variations On lithology, obscure any climatic signal. The correlation between yearly variations On precipitation and solute fluxes within individual watersheds Os stronger than the correlation between precipitation and solute fluxes of watersheds with different climatic regimes. This underscores the significance of transport-induced variability On controlling stream chemistry, and the importance of distinguishing between short-term and long-term climatic trends. No correlation exists between chemical fluxes and topographic relief or the extent of recent glaciation, implying that physical erosion rates do not have a critical influence on chemical weathering rates.},

  Abstract                 = {The effects of climatic temperature variations (5–35°C) on chemical weathering are investigated both experimentally using flow-through columns containing fresh and weathered granitoid rocks and for natural granitoid weathering in watersheds based on annual solute discharge. Although experimental Na and Si effluent concentrations are significantly higher in the fresh relative to the weathered granitoids, the proportional increases in concentration with increasing temperature are similar. Si and Na exhibit comparable average apparent activation energies (Ea) of 56 and 61 kJ/mol, respectively, which are similar to those reported for experimental feldspar dissolution measured over larger temperature ranges. A coupled temperature–precipitation model, using an expanded database for solute discharge fluxes from a global distribution of 86 granitoid watersheds, produces an apparent activation energy for Si (51 kJ/mol), which is also comparable to those derived from the experimental study. This correlation reinforces evidence that temperature does significantly impact natural silicate weathering rates.

Effluent K concentrations in the column study are elevated with respect to other cations compared to watershed discharge due to the rapid oxidation/dissolution of biotite. K concentrations are less sensitive to temperature, resulting in a lower average Ea value (27 kJ/mol) indicative of K loss from lower energy interlayer sites in biotite. At lower temperatures, initial cation release from biotite is significantly faster than cation release from plagioclase. This agrees with reported higher K/Na ratios in cold glacial watersheds relative to warmer temperate environments. Increased release of less radiogenic Sr from plagioclase relative to biotite at increasing temperature produces corresponding decreases in 87Sr/86Sr ratios in the column effluents. A simple mixing calculation using effluent K/Na ratios, Sr concentrations and 87Sr/86Sr ratios for biotite and plagioclase approximates stoichiometric cation ratios from biotite/plagioclase dissolution at warmer temperatures (35°C), but progressively overestimates the relative proportion of biotite with decreasing temperature. Ca, Mg, and Sr concentrations closely correlate, exhibit no consistent trends with temperature, and are controlled by trace amounts of calcite or exchange within weathered biotite. The inability of the watershed model to differentiate a climate signal for such species correlates with the lower temperature dependence observed in the experimental studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Mineral weathering rates are determined for a series of soils ranging in age from 0.2–3000 Ky developed on alluvial terraces near Merced in the Central Valley of California. Mineralogical and elemental abundances exhibit time-dependent trends documenting the chemical evolution of granitic sand to residual kaolinite and quartz. Mineral losses with time occur in the order: hornblende > plagioclase > K-feldspar. Maximum volume decreases of >50% occur in the older soils. BET surface areas of the bulk soils increase with age, as do specific surface areas of aluminosilicate mineral fractions such as plagioclase, which increases from 0.4–1.5 m2 g−1 over 600 Ky. Quartz surface areas are lower and change less with time (0.11–0.23 m2 g−1). BET surface areas correspond to increasing external surface roughness (lambda = 10–600) and relatively constant internal surface area (≈ 1.3 m2 g−1). SEM observations confirm both surface pitting and development of internal porosity.

A numerical model describes aluminosilicate dissolution rates as a function of changes in residual mineral abundance, grain size distributions, and mineral surface areas with time. A simple geometric treatment, assuming spherical grains and no surface roughness, predicts average dissolution rates (plagioclase, 10−17.4; K-feldspar, 10−17.8; and hornblende, 10−17.5 mol cm−1 s−1) that are constant with time and comparable to previous estimates of soil weathering. Average rates, based on BET surface area measurements and variable surface roughnesses, are much slower (plagioclase, 10−19.9; K-feldspar, 10−20.5; and hornblende 10−20.1 mol cm−2 s−1). Rates for individual soil horizons decrease by a factor of 101.5 over 3000 Ky indicating that the surface reactivities of minerals decrease as the physical surface areas increase. Rate constants based on BET estimates for the Merced soils are factors of 103–104 slower than reported experimental dissolution rates determined from freshly prepared silicates with low surface roughness (lambda< 10). This study demonstrates that the utility of experimental rate constants to predict weathering in soils is limited without consideration of variable surface areas and processes that control the evolution of surface reactivity with time.},

  Abstract                 = {On upland Triassic sandstone slopes of the western Blue Mountains, nonswamp, sclerophyllous heath (shrub-dominated vegetation) on shallow soils is commonly found downslope and adjacent to sclerophyllous forest on deeper soils. Some consider heath--and thus shallow soils--as favouring west-facing slopes, which are expected to experience drier microclimates due to insolation, strong and desiccating winds, and severe summer fires. However, our analysis of extensive areas with heath on shallow soils, based on vegetation and topographic maps, and fieldwork of uplands with various degrees of dissection, suggests that aspect is a poor predictor of shallow soils. Rather, shallow soils and heath are found on short slopes and the lower segments of longer slopes with the latter significantly steeper than forested segments.The shallow-deep soil boundary, marked by contrasting modern vegetation structures, does not signify a catchment area threshold, and correspondingly, the vegetation patterns are not in balance with distributary catchment processes, as short slopes are mantled exclusively by shallow soils. Instead, the soil depth boundary represents the propagation of base-level lowering signals, which takes place not only by the headward retreat of knickpoints but also via increased lowering of slope segments adjacent to drainage lines. This leads to steep slopes immediately adjacent to canyons, narrow gorges, and small steep valleys, that are mantled by shallow, discontinuous soils undergoing rapid erosion. These steep slopes persist in the landscape for >= 10 My after upland stream rejuvenation until incision of more weatherable Permian sediments, underlying the Triassic cliff-forming sandstones, triggers rapid lateral expansion of gorges. Once shallowly mantled and steeper slopes adjacent to streams are consumed by gorge widening, slopes adjacent to wide gorge clifflines reflect former upland drainage patterns rather than the redirected flow to rapidly widening gorges. Hence, modern vegetation patterns reflect a significant phase of landform development, perhaps combined with enhanced erosion during the Last Glacial Period that is compounded by a humped soil production function on bedrock.},

  Abstract                 = {The understanding, prediction, and modeling efficacy of soil organic carbon (SOC) distribution across fields and larger regions requires a large number of samples that are costly to analyze. The objective of this study was to evaluate soil color measurements to predict SOC for agriculture and prairie land uses. Munsell soil color book (B) and chroma meter (C) color readings were taken at the midpoint depth of each horizon (HB and HC) and predetermined depth increments (IB and IC) on 125 cores. Horizon matrix (HD) colors were determined by standard description. A chroma meter was used to determine the color of prepared samples, ground to <2 mm. Both color data sets were used in a regression analysis to predict SOC content by weight and volume. The best predictors for each technique are the models that incorporate Munsell value and chroma along with the depth from which the measurement was taken. Separating samples by land use improved the prediction of SOC. Transforming SOC content by log10 improved the coefficient of determination for nearly all models. The best predictors of SOC were HD for SOC by weight (agricultural field r2 = 0.79, prairie r2 = 0.53), HB for SOC by volume (agricultural field r2 = 0.76, prairie r2 = 0.57), and IC and IB for log-transformed SOC by weight and volume (agricultural field r2 = 0.84, prairie r2 = 0.62). This study indicates that while SOC content predictions can be made with field measurements, there are limitations to their predictive usefulness.},

  Abstract                 = {A study was initiated in soils of two southern Illinois loess-derived landscapes to investigate the distribution of selected trace and major elements. The objective of the research was to link the distribution of elements in different landscape positions to important soil and landscape processes. Seventeen pedons (representing different geomorphic hillslope positions) at the Morgan Pond (MP) and Bean Ridge (BR) sites were sampled by horizon. Data were evaluated by grouping selected horizons (A, Bt) by site (MP and BR) as well as by geomorphic hillslope position. Results show that relative concentrations of total As, Cr, Cu, V, Ni, Pb, Se, and Zn between these two sites were impacted by differences in inherent particle size distribution of the parent material. These elements were also greater in Bt versus A horizons within each site, suggesting that select elements were redistributed by clay illuviation processes. Barium, Ca, Cd, Hg, and Pb were all significantly elevated in A relative to Bt horizons at the BR site and were strongly correlated with total C, suggesting biocycling and trace element bioaccumulation were important in landscape positions of this site. The MP site lacked this same concentration of elements in surface horizons, demonstrating the effect of accelerated erosion due to more intensive cropping history. When grouping data by landscape position, elemental distribution and Bt/A clay ratios showed that landscape stability was greatest in summit positions relative to other positions (summit > shoulder > backslope positions), confirming that relative amount of soil erosion was also related to landscape position among these sites.},

  Abstract                 = {Site-specific management of soil fertility has been based on soil sampling in grid patterns or within soil mapping units without taking full advantage of terrain-soil relationships. The goal of this study was to determine whether terrain attributes relate significantly to soil K availability. The topographic wetness index (TWI), a terrain attribute that comprises the upstream contributing area and the slope for a portion of land, relates to soil wetness. We evaluated Mehlich-3 K (M3K), plant-available nonexchangeable K (PANK) with a modified tetraphenylboron extraction, effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC), and other soil variables from soil samples taken at three depths, and terrain attributes in a 3.6-ha farmed site in the Cincinnati catena, a major toposequence in the Muscatatuck Uplands region of Indiana. The PANK and M3K were significantly (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.05, respectively) related to TWI and relative elevation in models with anisotropic spatial autocorrelation variance estimates in three dimensions (latitude, longitude, and soil depth). The PANK and M3K increased with decreasing TWI in the following drainage class order: poorly < somewhat poorly < moderately well drained. The M3K decreased with soil depth, while PANK increased. The PANK/M3K ratio was significantly higher in the poorly drained soils than in the moderately well-drained soils, implying greater mobility or weathering of K in wetter soils. The ECEC also related strongly to terrain attributes (P < 0.0001 for relative elevation, TWI, and interaction effects). Possible mechanisms include lateral downslope lessivage and K leaching. Terrain attributes can aid in soil K fertility evaluations on the Cincinnati catena because they relate well to soil K fertility measurements.},

For exchange equilibria between Li-bearing aluminosilicates and the alkali feldspars, the activities of the alkali metals in solution under most of the conditions investigated follow the order Li>Na>K, and Na/Li and K/Li decrease with decreasing temperature. For exchange equilibria between pollucite and the alkali feldspars the order is Na>K>Cs in solution; Na/Cs and K/Cs increase strongly with decreasing temperature. The absolute values of these alkali metal ratios are in good agreement with the few available experimental data. The effect of chloride ion pairing on the calculated ratios is slight and does not consistently improve agreement between theory and experiment. These results suggest that the alteration of eucryptite, petalite or spodumene to albite and/or K-feldspar should be a normal consequence of the closed system evolution of rare element pegmatites upon cooling, in agreement with the ubiquity of such phenomena world-wide. On the other hand, alteration of pollucite to albite or K-feldspar upon cooling is only likely to occur if external fluids, with very high Na/Cs and/or K/Cs ratios, gain access to the pegmatite. Owing to the heterogeneity of rare element pegmatites, the fluid need not be external to the entire pegmatite, but could be simply external to the particular zone containing pollucite. Fluids in equilibrium with typical subsolidus rare metal pegmatite assemblages will invariably have high Li contents, thus explaining the common occurrence of Li-metasomatic halos about pegmatites. These same fluids are predicted to have relatively low Cs contents, in apparent agreement with the lesser role of Cs relative to Li in metasomatic halos. However, preferential formation of complexes of the alkali metals with fluoride, borate or aluminosilicate components potentially could alter the calculated alkali metal behaviors.},

  Abstract                 = {In general the field of exergy analysis is both well formulated and well understood. However, the exergy flux, or maximum work obtainable, from thermal radiation (TR) heat transfer has not been clearly formulated. In a previous article it was shown that Petela's result, from his thermodynamic approach, does in fact represent the exergy flux of blackbody radiation (BR) and the upper limit to the conversion of solar radiation (SR) fluxes approximated as BR. This conclusion was obtained by resolving a number of fundamental issues including questions relating to: inherent irreversibility, definition of the environment, the effect of inherent emission and the effect of concentrating source radiation. In this paper, a new expression based on inherent irreversibility is presented for the exergy flux of TR with an arbitrary spectrum. It is shown that previous approaches by Petela and Karlsson are equivalent and assume that reversible conversion of non-blackbody radiation (NBR) is theoretically possible. However, evidence is presented indicating that the conversion of NBR is inherently irreversible. The analysis in this paper emphasizes the proper formulation for TR exergy by re-stating the general exergy balance equation for thermodynamic systems so that it correctly applies to NBR heat transfer. Finally, it is shown that the exergy flux of NBR, or the maximum work obtainable from NBR conversion, can be a small fraction of the energy flux.},

  Abstract                 = {To evaluate the effect of soil moisture deficit on the restriction of evaporation from bare soil surfaces, the process of evaporation in dry soil was investigated from field observations at a fallow site and a sand dune site. Analysis of the surface energy balance showed that soil drying affects not only the inter-diurnal variation of energy fluxes, but also their diurnal variation. In addition, the relationship between the surface resistance (rs) and soil water content ([theta]) of surface soil was found to be different between inter-diurnal and diurnal time scales. Stable isotopic analysis of soil water showed that liquid water transport from deeper soil layers stops at the bottom boundary of the dry surface layer (DSL) and that vapor water transport is dominant in the DSL. In addition, diurnal variations in water content and soil air humidity suggest that evaporation and condensation occurs alternatively within the DSL with diurnal cycle due to cyclic change in solar radiation and soil temperature. From these observational results, a conceptual model of the dynamics of the evaporation zone in dry sandy soils is presented. In the model, the evaporation zone consists of two sub-zones: a narrow sub-zone around the bottom boundary of the DSL, and a relatively wide sub-zone within the DSL. The former is active through a day and moves vertically with the development/reduction of the DSL at both diurnal and inter-diurnal time scales. The latter acts as evaporation zone only in the morning and acts as condensation zone in the late afternoon and at night. The dynamic behavior of the evaporation zone and those related to the form of water content profile can explain the difference in the rs-[theta] relationship between inter-diurnal and diurnal time scales.},

  Abstract                 = {The key Soil Taxonomy is based upon the idea that certain properties can be used to define populations of soils from the soil continuum. The soil mapping paradigm is that similar soil populations exist within landforms. High taxonomic variability has been reported within numerous soil mapping units. The hypotheses in this paper are that for large scale mapping (i) Soil Taxonomy creates classes that are only partially related to landform and (ii) more homogeneous soil classes exist if different defining constructs are used. The objectives are to: (i) classify a sampling of soils within a 40-ha upland pasture using both Soil Taxonomy and cluster analysis, (ii) identify the distinctness and relationships of these samples to landforms, and (iii) compare the geographic distributions of soil classes identified by Soil Taxonomy and cluster analyses. Ninety-four soil properties were measured from 257 pedons along point transects. Cluster analysis identified three pedologically and geographically distinct groups. A single cluster group was identified for soils within the "ridge" landform, whereas the "backslope" landform was a mixture of all three groups. A significant relationship was found for soil attributes and slope profile curvature within the backslope landform, but predictive value was low. Soil Taxonomy produced 13 geographically indistinct classes that were partially related to cluster groupings. Cluster analysis appears to be useful for revealing patterns of soil homogeneity and for identifying relationships among soil properties and landforms. Numerical analysis may be a helpful supplementary method for correlating soil surveys with large soil databases, or for defining those soil attributes which distinguish mappable bodies from the soil continuum.},

  Abstract                 = {The development of new technologies for use in field soil survey has produced powerful new quantitative tools for assessing soil physicochemical properties in-situ. One such technology, portable X-ray fluorescence (PXRF) spectrometry, has shown considerable promise in evaluating elemental concentrations in soils for a wide variety of applications. Less research is available on how \{PXRF\} can be applied to quantify soil physical properties (e.g. soil texture). This study evaluated the feasibility of predicting soil clay and sand contents from \{PXRF\} data on 584 soil samples collected from highly diverse regions of Louisiana and northeastern New Mexico (Capulin Volcano National Monument), USA. An Innov-X Delta Premium \{PXRF\} was used to sequentially scan soil samples under both field and laboratory conditions and assess 15 elements (K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, As, Rb, Sr, Zr, Ba, and Pb). Elemental concentrations were then related to soil textural data processed through traditional laboratory methods with multiple linear regression. Among all elements evaluated, Fe and Rb showed particular significance for soil textural prediction. The regression models for sand and clay contents of both study sites were strongly correlated to soil textural separates with PXRF-soil texture \{R2\} of 0.862, 0.959, 0.892, and 0.780 for Louisiana sand and clay, and Capulin sand and clay, respectively. Independent validation sub-datasets confirmed that \{PXRF\} readings can be used to estimate soil textural parameters with high \{R2\} values of 0.854, 0.682, 0.975, 0.891, 0.875, and 0.876, and low \{RMSE\} values of 5.53%, 5.92%, 2.68%, 6.26%, 5.43%, and 2.66%, for Louisiana sand, silt, and clay and Capulin sand, silt, and clay, respectively. The \{RMSE\} values of clay are substantially lower than those reported in previous studies using other proximal sensing techniques. While regional differences may require localized standardization of the \{PXRF\} with a unique combination of elements germane to the study area, \{PXRF\} shows considerable promise as a technique for rapidly assessing soil textural separates in-situ. },
